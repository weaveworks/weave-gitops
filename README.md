Weave GitOps is a simple, open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications but who don't have
Kubernetes expertise. Experience how easy it is to enable GitOps and run your apps in a cluster. Use Git to collaborate
with team members making new deployments easy and secure. Start with what developers need to run apps, and then easily
extend to define and run your own enterprise platform.

From Kubernetes run Weave GitOps to get:

1. Application Operations: manage and automate deployment pipelines for apps and more
2. Platforms: the easy way to have your own custom PaaS on cloud or on premise
3. Extensions: coordinate Kubernetes rollouts with eg. VMs, databases, and cloud services

Our vision is that all cloud native applications should be easy for developers, and that operations should be
automated and secure. Weave GitOps is a highly extensible tool to achieve this by placing Kubernetes and GitOps at the
core and building a platform around that.

Weave GitOps defaults are [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/) as the GitOps engine, Kustomize, Helm, Sops, and Kubernetes CAPI. If you use Flux already, then you can easily add Weave GitOps to create a platform management overlay.

Weave GitOps Open Source provides:

- Continuous Delivery through GitOps for apps and infrastructure.
- Support for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket; S3-compatible buckets as a source; all major container registries; and all CI workflow providers.
- A secure, pull-based mechanism, operating with least amount of privileges, and adhering to Kubernetes security policies.
- Compatibility with any conformant Kubernetes version and common ecosystem technologies such as Helm, Kustomize, RBAC, Prometheus, OPA, Kyverno, etc.
- Multitenancy, multiple Git repositories, multiple clusters.
- Alerts and notifications.

### Manage and view applications all in one place.

![Application Page](./doc/img/01-workloads.png)

### Easily see your continuous deployments and what is being produced via GitOps. There are multiple views for debugging as well as being able to sync your latest Git commits directly from the UI.

### See your entire source landscape whether it is a git repository, helm repository, or bucket.

### Quickly see the health of your reconciliation deployment runtime. These are the workers that are ensuring your software is running on the Kubernetes cluster.
