    # The generation strategy to use. There are two options:
    #
    # 1. "directory"
    #
    #   This will result in buf splitting the input files by directory, and making separate plugin
    #   invocations in parallel. This is roughly the concurrent equivalent of:
    #
    #     for dir in $(find . -name '*.proto' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 dirname | sort | uniq); do
    #       protoc -I . $(find "${dir}" -name '*.proto')
    #     done
    #
    #   Almost every Protobuf plugin either requires this, or works with this,
    #   and this is the recommended and default value.
    #
    # 2. "all"
    #
    #   This will result in buf making a single plugin invocation with all input files.
    #   This is roughly the equivalent of:
    #
    #     protoc -I . $(find . -name '*.proto')
    #
    #   This is needed for certain plugins that expect all files to be given at once.
    #
    # Optional. If omitted, "directory" is used. Most users should not need to set this option.
