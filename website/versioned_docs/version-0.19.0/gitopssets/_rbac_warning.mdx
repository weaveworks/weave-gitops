**To run this example you will need extra RBAC**

This particular example creates kustomizations, so you will need to add the below RBAC
to the `gitopssets-controller-manager` service account to allow it to create kustomizations.

Check out the [Security](./intro.mdx#security) section for more information.

**However this will change in the next release with impersonation. Instead you can choose a service account
for each `GitOpsSet` that has the required permissions for creating the rendered resources in the
`templates` section.**

Additional RBAC for the `gitopssets-controller-manager` service account:
