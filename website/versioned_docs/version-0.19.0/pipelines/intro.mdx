As [wikipedia defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery), Continuous delivery is

>a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles,
>ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, without doing so manually.
>It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency.

>Continuous delivery is enabled through the deployment pipeline.
>The purpose of the deployment pipeline has three components: visibility, feedback, and continually deploy.[12]

Weave Gitops Enterprise Pipelines allows you to define your deployment pipelines to enable continuous delivery for
your gitops applications.

As part of Weave GitOps Enterprise, you can

- [Define a delivery pipeline](../getting-started/#define-a-pipeline) that you want you application to follow
- [View a pipeline](../getting-started/#view-the-list-of-pipelines) and check the status of your deployments.

Now that you know what delivery pipelines can do for you, follow the [guide to get started](../getting-started).
