# Weave GitOps

Weave GitOps is a powerful extension to [Flux][flux], a leading GitOps engine and
CNCF project. Weave GitOps provides insights into your application deployments,
and makes continuous delivery with GitOps easier to adopt and scale across your teams.

Its web UI surfaces key information to help application operators easily discover
and resolve issues. The intuitive interface provides a guided experience to build
understanding and simplify getting started for new users; they can easily discover
the relationship between Flux objects and navigate to deeper levels of information as required.

Weave GitOps is an open source project sponsored by [Weaveworks](https://weave.works) - the GitOps company,
and original creators of [Flux][flux].

## Why adopt GitOps?

> "GitOps is the best thing since configuration as code. Git changed how we collaborate, but declarative configuration is the key to dealing with infrastructure at scale, and sets the stage for the next generation of management tools"

<cite>- Kelsey Hightower, Staff Developer Advocate, Google.</cite><br/><br/>

Adopting GitOps can bring a number of key benefits:

- Faster and more frequent deployments
- Easy recovery from failures
- Improved security and auditability
