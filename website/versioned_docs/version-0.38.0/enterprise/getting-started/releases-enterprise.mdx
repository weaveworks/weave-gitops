## v0.35.0
2023-10-28

### Highlights

#### Improvements to Pipelines UI

Our Pipelines view is getting an overhaul as part of fundamental changes to make this feature simpler to use and more powerful. In this release, we’ve made the current app version prompt clearer about what it is showing. We’ve added summary boxes to environments in order to show how many targets have successfully updated. We’ve made it easier to find information about the promotion strategy used in an environment, so that users can better understand what's happening in that environment. Lastly, we better display the promotion strategy used in an environment.

#### New feature

You can now _disconnect_ `GitopsClusters` which involves removing the resources that were added when _connecting_ them.

The command mirrors the `gitops connect cluster` command in functionality.

Instructions are available in the CLI:

```console
gitops disconnect cluster --help
```

### ⚠ Breaking Changes

#### Explorer Configuration

We have changed the way the `explorer` feature is enabled. It is now possible to enable or disable `explorer` on different parts of the application. Previously, there was a global toggle set in the Helm Chart values called `enableExplorer`. This flag has been replaced by two keys: `explorer.enabled` and `explorer.enabledFor`:

```yaml
explorer:
  enabled: true # global enable/disable flag
  # ...
  enabledFor: # list of components that can be enabled or disabled
    - applications
    - sources
    - gitopssets
    - templates
  ```
Adding or removing items from this list will control which parts of the UI utilize the explorer backend.

The current values that are supported for this key:
```yaml
    - applications
    - sources
    - gitopssets
    - templates
 ```
See this section of the docs for more info: https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/explorer/getting-started/

#### Monitoring Configuration

We have updated configuration values embedding `metrics` under `monitoring`. In case you
have disabled metrics in your helm release values previously by setting:
```
metrics:
  enabled: false
```
You should update it to have he same behavior
```
monitoring:
  enabled: false
```

Please review [monitoring](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/operations/monitoring/) for more info.

- Cross namespace support lands, create resources in multiple namespaces, they'll also be cleaned up properly via finalizers.
- The **Sync** button in the UI now works correctly

#### Profiles and Charts

- You can now filter out the versions that will be shown from a HelmRepository when installing a chart via annotations:
  - `"weave.works/helm-version-filter": "> 0.0.0"` to filter out rc releases
  - `"weave.works/helm-version-filter": "> 1.0.0"` to filter any pre 1.0 releases
  - `"weave.works/helm-version-filter": "> 3.0.0-0"` to filter any pre 3.0 releases but include rc releases

#### Explorer

### Breaking Changes

(none)

### Known issues

#### Explorer

- Full-text search with terms including special characters like dashes (-) returns more results than expected by exact match term. For example, searching by term "flux-system" is treated as two terms: "flux" & "system" so returns the results for the joint of them.  A fix for this will be part of the following releases.

Users also will have the ability to navigate to each ExternalSecret and know the details of the secret, its sync status, and the last time this secret has been updated, as well as the latest events associated with the secret.

#### Pipelines
- Retry promotion on failure. Now if a promotion fails there is an automatic retry functionalty, you can configure the threshold and delay via the CLI.
- Promotion webhook rate limiting. We enable now the configuration of the rate limit for the promotion webhooks.

### Minor fixes
#### Workspaces
** [UI] "Tenant" ** is renamed to "Workspace" on details page.

** [UI] Use time.RFC3339 ** format for all timestamps of the workspaces tabs.

#### Other
** [UI] Error notification boundary ** does not allow user to navigate away from the page.

### Highlights

#### GitOps Templates Path feature
- GitOps templates now provide the capability to write resources to multiple
	paths in the Git repository. This feature allows complex scenarios, like for
	example creating a self-service for an application that requires an RDS
	database. We’ve provided
	[documentation](../../gitops-templates/repo-rendered-paths.mdx) which has a example.

```yaml
spec:
  resourcetemplates:
    - path: ./clusters/${CLUSTER_NAME}/definition/cluster.yaml
      content:
        - apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
          kind: Cluster
          metadata:
            name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
          ...
        - apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
          kind: AWSCluster
          metadata:
            name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
          ...
    - path: ./clusters/${CLUSTER_NAME}/workloads/helmreleases.yaml
      content:
        - apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
          kind: HelmRelease
          metadata:
            name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-nginx
          ...
        - apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
          kind: HelmRelease
          metadata:
            name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-cert-manager
          ...
```

#### Workspace UI
- Weave GitOps now provides a GUI for Workspaces.

#### Enhanced Terraform Table in UI
- Weave GitOps now provides more details on the Terraform inventory GUI page. Adding the type and identifier fields to the inventory table, plus filtering and a 'no data' message.

#### Keyboard shortcuts for "port forwards" on GitOps Run
- Weave GitOps now building and printing a list of set up port forwards.
- Weave GitOps now opening the selected port forward URL on key press. Listening for keypress is performed with the `github.com/mattn/go-tty` package (other options required pressing Enter after a keypress, this catches just a single numeric keypress) and opening URLs with the `github.com/pkg/browser` package.

#### Minor fixes
**[UI] Notifications** Fixed provider page showing a 404.

### Dependency versions

### Breaking changes

No breaking changes

## v0.12.0
2022-12-09

### Highlights

**We highly recommend users of v0.11.0 upgrade to this version as it includes fixes for a number of UI issues.**

#### GitOps Templates

- Support to specify Helm charts inside the CRD, instead of annotations. We’ve
	provided [documentation](../../gitops-templates/profiles.mdx) which has a example.

```yaml
spec:
  charts:
    items:
      - chart: cert-manager
        version: v1.5.3
        editable: false
        required: true
        values:
          installCRDs: ${CERT_MANAGER_INSTALL_CRDS}
        targetNamespace: cert-manager
        layer: layer-1
        template:
          content:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app.kubernetes.io/name: cert-manager
            spec:
              retries: ${CERT_MANAGER_RETRY_COUNT}
```

- Ability to edit all fields now, including name/namespace

#### Authentication with OIDC support
Supporting custom OIDC groups claims for azure/okta integration
Support for OIDC custom username and group claims:

```yaml
config
  oidc:
    claimUsername: ""
    claimGroups: ""
```

#### Policy commit-time agent
- Support Azure DevOps and auto-remediation in commit-time enforcement.

#### Admin User- simpler RBAC
- Weave GitOps default admin user can now “read” all objects. Why is this important? As users are trying out Weave GitOps they will most likely try it out with some of their favorite Cloud Native tools such as Crossplane, Tekton, Istio, etc. This enables them to see all of those resources and explore the full power of Weave GitOps. We still do not recommend this user for “production-use” cases, and customers should always be pushed towards implementing OIDC with scoped roles.

#### Pipelines - adding Pipelines through Templates
- From the Pipelines view you can add new Pipelines in a way which leverages GitOpsTemplates, additionally - to help users configure these, we’ve provided [documentation](../../pipelines/pipelines-templates.mdx) which has some samples.

#### Support for multiple Flux instances on a single cluster
- Support for running multiple flux instances in different namespaces on a single cluster for resource isolation.

#### Minor fixes

**Terraform CRD Error**
Users of the Terraform Controller will be pleased to know we’ve addressed the issue where an error would be displayed if it had not been installed on all connected clusters.

**Management cluster renaming**
If the name of the cluster where Weave GitOps Enterprise is installed, was changed from the default of management through the config.cluster.name parameter, certain workflows could fail such as fetching profiles, this has now been resolved.

### Dependency versions​
weave-gitops v0.12.0
cluster-controller v1.4.1
cluster-bootstrap-controller v0.3.0
(optional) pipeline-controller v0.0.11
(optional) policy-agent 2.1.1

### Known issues
- [UI] Notifications provider page shows a 404.

## v0.11.0
2022-11-25

### Highlights

#### GitOpsTemplates
- We are working towards unifying CAPI and GitOps Templates under a single umbrella. For those already using CAPITemplates, we will ensure a smooth transition is possible by making use of a conversion hooks. There are some breaking changes for GitOpsTemplates as part of this transitionary period, so be sure to check the guidance under [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes).
- We now retain the ordering of parameters in the template instead of sorting them alphabetically. Providing to the author control in what sequence the parameters are rendered in the form and thus present a more logically grouped set of parameters to the end consumer.
- You can control what
	[delimiters](../../gitops-templates/supported-langs.mdx#custom-delimiters) you
	want to use in a template. This provides flexibility for if you want to use
	the syntax for dynamic functions like the [helper functions](../../gitops-templates/supported-langs.mdx#supported-functions-1) we support.

#### Pipelines
- This [feature](pipelines/pipelines-intro.mdx) is now enabled by default when you install the Weave GitOps Enterprise Helm Chart. You can toggle this with the `enablePipelines` flag.
- GitOpsTemplates are a highly flexible way to create new resources - including Pipelines. We now provide a shortcut on the Pipelines table view to navigate you to Templates with the `weave.works/template-type=pipeline` label.

#### Telemetry
This release incorporates anonymous aggregate user behavior analytics to help us continuously improve the product. As an Enterprise customer, this is enabled by default. You can learn more about this [here](/feedback-and-telemetry#anonymous-aggregate-user-behavior-analytics).

### Dependency versions
- weave-gitops v0.11.0
- cluster-controller v1.4.1
- cluster-bootstrap-controller v0.3.0
- (optional) pipeline-controller v0.0.11
- (optional) policy-agent 2.1.1

### Breaking changes

#### GitOpsTemplates and CAPITemplates
We are making these changes to provide a unified and intuitive self-service experience within Weave GitOps Enterprise, removing misleading and potentially confusing terminology born from when only Clusters were backed by Templates.

**New API Group for the GitOpsTemplate CRD**
- old: `clustertemplates.weave.works`
- new: `templates.weave.works`

After upgrading Weave GitOps Enterprise which includes the updated CRD:
1. Update all your GitOpsTemplates in Git changing all occurrences of `apiVersion: clustertemplates.weave.works/v1alpha1` to `apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1`.
2. Commit, push and reconcile. They should now be viewable in the Templates view again.
3. Clean up the old CRD. As it stands:
   - `kubectl get gitopstemplate -A` will be empty as it is pointing to the old `clustertemplates.weave.works` CRD.
   - `kubectl get gitopstemplate.templates.weave.works -A` will work
To fix the former of the commands, remove the old CRD (helm does not do this automatically for safety reasons):
   - `kubectl delete crd gitopstemplates.clustertemplates.weave.works`
   - You may have to wait up to 5 minutes for your local kubectl CRD cache to invalidate, then `kubectl get gitopstemplate -A` should be working as usual

**Template Profiles / Applications / Credentials sections are hidden by default**

For both `CAPITemplates` and `GitopsTemplates` the default visibility for all sections in a template has been set to `"false"`. To re-enable profiles or applications on a template you can tweak the annotations

```yaml
annotations:
  templates.weave.works/profiles-enabled: "true" # enable profiles
  templates.weave.works/kustomizations-enabled: "true" # enable applications
  templates.weave.works/credentials-enabled: "true" # enable CAPI credentials
```

**The default values for a profile are not fetched and included in a pull-request**

Prior to this release WGE would fetch the default values.yaml for every profile installed and include them in the `HelmReleases` in the Pull Request when rendering out the profiles of a template.

This was an expensive operation and occasionally led to timeouts.

The new behaviour is to omit the values and fall back to the defaults included in the helm-chart. This sacrifices some UX (being able to see all the defaults in the PR and tweak them) to improve performance. **There should not be any final behaviour changes to the installed charts**.

You can still view and tweak the `values.yaml` when selecting profiles to include on the "Create resource (cluster)" page. If changes are made here the updated values.yaml will be included.
