## Workspaces

Organizations working with Kubernetes have a tremendous need to manage tenancy for numerous software delivery teams. Weave GitOps Workspaces offers tenancy management for Kubernetes clusters at scale. Itâ€™s built on top of Flux's powerful approach to managing tenancy, and adds policies that will help you to define finer-grain rules on your tenants. 

With WGE Workspaces, all it takes for platform operators to create workspaces is a single CLI command that generates:
- all the necessary YAML configuration files necessary for tenant setup
- a list of policies that apply to each workspace
- the list of repositories to which each workspace has access.
