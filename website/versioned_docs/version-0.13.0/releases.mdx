## v0.13.0
2022-12-22
### Highlights

#### GitOps Templates Path feature
- GitOps templates now provide the capability to write resources to multiple paths in the Git repository. This feature allows complex scenarios, like for example creating a self-service for an application that requires an RDS database. We’ve provided [documentation](./gitops-templates/templates.mdx#template-paths) which has a example.

```yaml
spec:
  resourcetemplates:
    - path: ./clusters/${CLUSTER_NAME}/definition/cluster.yaml
      content:
        - apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
          kind: Cluster
          metadata:
            name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
          ...
        - apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
          kind: AWSCluster
          metadata:
            name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
          ...
    - path: ./clusters/${CLUSTER_NAME}/workloads/helmreleases.yaml
      content:
        - apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
          kind: HelmRelease
          metadata:
            name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-nginx
          ...
        - apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
          kind: HelmRelease
          metadata:
            name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-cert-manager
          ...
```

#### Workspace UI 
- Weave GitOps now provides a GUI for Workspaces. 

#### Enhanced Terraform Table in UI 
- Weave GitOps now provides more details on the Terraform inventory GUI page. Adding the type and identifier fields to the inventory table, plus filtering and a 'no data' message.

#### Keyboard shortcuts for "port forwards" on GitOps Run
- Weave GitOps now building and printing a list of set up port forwards.
- Weave GitOps now opening the selected port forward URL on key press. Listening for keypress is performed with the `github.com/mattn/go-tty` package (other options required pressing Enter after a keypress, this catches just a single numeric keypress) and opening URLs with the `github.com/pkg/browser` package.

#### Minor fixes
**[UI] Notifications** Fixed provider page showing a 404. 

### Dependency versions

- weave-gitops v0.13.0
- cluster-controller v1.4.1
- cluster-bootstrap-controller v0.3.0
- (optional) pipeline-controller v0.8.0
- (optional) policy-agent v2.2.0

### Breaking changes

No breaking changes

## v0.12.0
2022-12-09

### Highlights

**We highly recommend users of v0.11.0 upgrade to this version as it includes fixes for a number of UI issues.**

#### GitOps Templates

- Support to specify Helm charts inside the CRD, instead of annotations. We’ve provided [documentation](./gitops-templates/templates.mdx) which has a example. 

```yaml
spec:
  charts:
    items:
      - chart: cert-manager
        version: v1.5.3
        editable: false
        required: true
        values:
          installCRDs: ${CERT_MANAGER_INSTALL_CRDS}
        targetNamespace: cert-manager
        layer: layer-1
        template:
          content:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app.kubernetes.io/name: cert-manager
            spec:
              retries: ${CERT_MANAGER_RETRY_COUNT}
```

- Ability to edit all fields now, including name/namespace

#### Authentication with OIDC support
Supporting custom OIDC groups claims for azure/okta integration
Support for OIDC custom username and group claims:

```yaml
config
  oidc:
    claimUsername: ""
    claimGroups: ""
```

#### Policy commit-time agent 
- Support Azure DevOps and auto-remediation in commit-time enforcement.

#### Admin User- simpler RBAC 
- Weave GitOps default admin user can now “read” all objects. Why is this important? As users are trying out Weave GitOps they will most likely try it out with some of their favorite Cloud Native tools such as Crossplane, Tekton, Istio, etc. This enables them to see all of those resources and explore the full power of Weave GitOps. We still do not recommend this user for “production-use” cases, and customers should always be pushed towards implementing OIDC with scoped roles.

#### Pipelines - adding Pipelines through Templates
- From the Pipelines view you can add new Pipelines in a way which leverages GitOpsTemplates, additionally - to help users configure these, we’ve provided [documentation](./pipelines/pipeline-templates.mdx) which has some samples.

#### Support for multiple Flux instances on a single cluster
- Support for running multiple flux instances in different namespaces on a single cluster for resource isolation.

#### Minor fixes

**Terraform CRD Error**
Users of the Terraform Controller will be pleased to know we’ve addressed the issue where an error would be displayed if it had not been installed on all connected clusters.

**Management cluster renaming**
If the name of the cluster where Weave GitOps Enterprise is installed, was changed from the default of management through the config.cluster.name parameter, certain workflows could fail such as fetching profiles, this has now been resolved.

### Dependency versions​
weave-gitops v0.12.0
cluster-controller v1.4.1
cluster-bootstrap-controller v0.3.0
(optional) pipeline-controller v0.0.11
(optional) policy-agent 2.1.1

### Known issues
- [UI] Notifications provider page shows a 404. 

## v0.11.0
2022-11-25

### Highlights

#### GitOpsTemplates
- We are working towards unifying CAPI and GitOps Templates under a single umbrella. For those already using CAPITemplates, we will ensure a smooth transition is possible by making use of a conversion hooks. There are some breaking changes for GitOpsTemplates as part of this transitionary period, so be sure to check the guidance under [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes).
- We now retain the ordering of parameters in the template instead of sorting them alphabetically. Providing to the author control in what sequence the parameters are rendered in the form and thus present a more logically grouped set of parameters to the end consumer.
- You can control what [delimiters](./gitops-templates/templates.mdx#custom-delimiters-for-rendertype-templating) you want to use in a template. This provides flexibility for if you want to use the syntax for dynamic functions like the [helper functions](./gitops-templates/templates.mdx#supported-functions-from-sprig-library) we support.

#### Pipelines
- This [feature](pipelines/intro.mdx) is now enabled by default when you install the Weave GitOps Enterprise Helm Chart. You can toggle this with the `enablePipelines` flag. 
- GitOpsTemplates are a highly flexible way to create new resources - including Pipelines. We now provide a shortcut on the Pipelines table view to navigate you to Templates with the `weave.works/template-type=pipeline` label.

#### Telemetry
This release incorporates anonymous aggregate user behavior analytics to help us continuously improve the product. As an Enterprise customer, this is enabled by default. You can learn more about this [here](../feedback-and-telemetry#anonymous-aggregate-user-behavior-analytics).

### Dependency versions
- weave-gitops v0.11.0
- cluster-controller v1.4.1
- cluster-bootstrap-controller v0.3.0
- (optional) pipeline-controller v0.0.11
- (optional) policy-agent 2.1.1

### Breaking changes

#### GitOpsTemplates and CAPITemplates
We are making these changes to provide a unified and intuitive self-service experience within Weave GitOps Enterprise, removing misleading and potentially confusing terminology born from when only Clusters were backed by Templates.

**New API Group for the GitOpsTemplate CRD**
- old: `clustertemplates.weave.works`
- new: `templates.weave.works`

After upgrading Weave GitOps Enterprise which includes the updated CRD:
1. Update all your GitOpsTemplates in Git changing all occurrences of `apiVersion: clustertemplates.weave.works/v1alpha1` to `apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1`.
2. Commit, push and reconcile. They should now be viewable in the Templates view again.
3. Clean up the old CRD. As it stands:
   - `kubectl get gitopstemplate -A` will be empty as it is pointing to the old `clustertemplates.weave.works` CRD.
   - `kubectl get gitopstemplate.templates.weave.works -A` will work
To fix the former of the commands, remove the old CRD (helm does not do this automatically for safety reasons):
   - `kubectl delete crd gitopstemplates.clustertemplates.weave.works`
   - You may have to wait up to 5 minutes for your local kubectl CRD cache to invalidate, then `kubectl get gitopstemplate -A` should be working as usual

**Template Profiles / Applications / Credentials sections are hidden by default**

For both `CAPITemplates` and `GitopsTemplates` the default visibility for all sections in a template has been set to `"false"`. To re-enable profiles or applications on a template you can tweak the annotations

```yaml
annotations:
  templates.weave.works/profiles-enabled: "true" # enable profiles
  templates.weave.works/kustomizations-enabled: "true" # enable applications
  templates.weave.works/credentials-enabled: "true" # enable CAPI credentials
```

**The default values for a profile are not fetched and included in a pull-request**

Prior to this release WGE would fetch the default values.yaml for every profile installed and include them in the `HelmReleases` in the Pull Request when rendering out the profiles of a template.

This was an expensive operation and occasionally led to timeouts.

The new behaviour is to omit the values and fall back to the defaults included in the helm-chart. This sacrifices some UX (being able to see all the defaults in the PR and tweak them) to improve performance. **There should not be any final behaviour changes to the installed charts**.

You can still view and tweak the `values.yaml` when selecting profiles to include on the "Create resource (cluster)" page. If changes are made here the updated values.yaml will be included.

  - `deploymentRBAC` section in `tenancy.yaml` allows you to specify the permissions given to the flux `Kustomizations` that will apply the resources from git to your tenants' namespaces in the cluster.
  - Support for `OCIRepository` sources when restricting/allowing the sources that can be applied into tenants' namespaces.
- **Templates**
  - Templates now support helm functions for simple transformations of values: `{{ .params.CLUSTER_NAME | upper }}`
  - Templates has moved to its own page in the UI, this is the first step in moving towards embracing them as a more generic feature, not just for cluster creation.
  - If a version is not specified in a **template profile annotation** it can be selected by the user.
  - A `namespace` can be specified in the **template profile annotation** that will be provided as the `HelmRelease`'s `targetNamespace` by default.
- **Bootstrapping**
  - A ClusterBootstrapConfig can now optionally be triggered when `phase="Provisioned"`, rather than `ControlPlaneReady=True` status.

### Dependency versions

**old**
```yaml
policy-agent:
  enabled: true
  accountId: "my-account"
  clusterId: "my-cluster"
```

**new**
```yaml
policy-agent:
  enabled: true
  config:
    accountId: "my-account"
    clusterId: "my-cluster"
```
