This page summarises the contents of the [securing access to the dashboard](securing-access-to-the-dashboard.mdx),
[service account permissions](service-account-permissions.mdx) and [user permissions](user-permissions.mdx). They should be
read in addition to this page in order to understand the suggestions made here and
their ramifications.

This page is purposefully vague as the intention is to give a broad idea of how
such a system could be implemented, not the specifics as that will be dependent
on your specific circumstances and goals.

:::note Gitops-Core
These recommendations are for Weave GitOps Core. You can find recommendations for
Weave GitOps Enterprise [here](../enterprise/user-permissions.mdx).
:::

## Summary

The general recommendation is to use OIDC and a small number of groups that
are Weave GitOps can impersonate.

OIDC is the recommended method for managing authentication as it decouples the
need to manage user lists from the application, allowing it to be managed via
a central system designed for that purpose (i.e. the OIDC provider). OIDC also
enables the creation of groups (either via your provider's own systems or by
using a connector like [Dex](../guides/setting-up-dex.md)).

Configuring Weave GitOps to impersonate kubernetes groups rather than
users has the following benefits:
* A user's permissions for impersonation by Weave GitOps can be separate from
  any other permissions that they may or may not have within the cluster.
* Users do not have to be individually managed within the cluster and can have
  their permissions managed together.

## Example set up

Assume that your company has the following people in OIDC
* Aisha, a cluster admin, who should have full admin access to Weave GitOps
* Brian, lead of team-A, who should have admin permissions to their team's
  namespace in Weave GitOps and readonly-otherwise
* June and Jo, developers in team-A who should have read-only access to Weave GitOps.

You could then create 3 groups:

* `wego-admin`
  - Bound to the `ClusterRole`, created by Helm, `wego-admin-cluster-role`
  - Aisha is the only member
* `wego-team-a-admin`
  - Bound to a `Role`, using the same permissions as `wego-admin-role`, created
    in Team's namespace
  - Brian and Aisha are members
* `wego-readonly`
  - Bound to a `ClusterRole` that matches `wego-admin-cluster-role` but with
    no `patch` permissions.
  - Aisha, Brian, June & Jo are all members

The Weave GitOps service account can then be configured with:
```yaml
rbac:
  impersonationResourceNames: ["wego-admin", "wego-team-a-admin", "wego-readonly"]
  impersonationResources: ["groups"]
```
so that only these three groups can be `impersonated` by the service account.

:::caution Using OIDC for cluster and Weave GitOps Authentication
If the same OIDC provider is used to authenticate a user with the cluster
itself (e.g. for use with `kubectl`) and to Weave GitOps then, depending
on OIDC configuration, they may end up with the super-set of their permissions
from Weave GitOps and any other permissions granted to them.

This can lead to un-intended consequences (e.g. viewing `secrets`). To avoid
this OIDC providers will often let you configure which groups are returned
to which clients: the Weave GitOps groups should not be returned to the
cluster client (and visa versa).

### Code

The yaml to configure these permissions would look roughly like:
```yaml
# Admin cluster role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: wego-admin-cluster-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["secrets", "pods" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list" ]
  - apiGroups: ["apps"]
    resources: [ "deployments", "replicasets"]
    verbs: [ "get", "list" ]
  - apiGroups: ["kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "kustomizations" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "patch" ]
  - apiGroups: ["helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "helmreleases" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "patch" ]
  - apiGroups: ["source.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "buckets", "helmcharts", "gitrepositories", "helmrepositories" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "patch" ]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["events"]
    verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
