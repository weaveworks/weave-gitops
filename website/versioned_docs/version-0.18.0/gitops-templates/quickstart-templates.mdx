# Quickstart Gitops Templates

`Quickstart` templates are [gitops templates](https://docs.gitops.weaveworks.org/docs/gitops-templates/templates/)
that you could use to get started with Weave Gitops Enterprise. It aims to provide a basic experience to simplify
the first time you step up with us.

## Getting Started

The templates exist as helm chart in [weave-gitops-quickstart](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops-quickstart)
