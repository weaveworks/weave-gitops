WGEE provides ops teams with an easy way to assess the
health of multiple clusters in a single place. It shows cluster information such as
Kubernetes version and number of nodes and provides details about the GitOps operations
on those clusters, such as Git repositories and recent commits. Additionally, it
aggregates Prometheus alerts to assist with troubleshooting.

If you have already purchased your entitlement, head to the [installation page](./installation/weave-gitops-enterprise/index.mdx).

## Feature breakdown

In addition to the features in the OSS edition, Weave GitOps Enterprise Edition
offers the following capabilities, taking your delivery from simple CD to IDP:

### :boat: <Link to="../cluster-management/intro" target="_blank">Cluster Fleet Management</Link>
Deploy the same application into many different clusters even across
cloud and hybrid environments, allowing change deployments across the fleet
via Git and Cluster API.

### :closed_lock_with_key: <Link to="../policy/intro" target="_blank">Trusted Application Delivery</Link>
Add policy as code to GitOps pipelines and enforce security and compliance,
application resilience and coding standards from source to production.
Validate policy conformance at every step in the software delivery pipeline:
commit, build, deploy and run time.

### :black_right_pointing_double_triangle_with_vertical_bar: <Link to='../guides/delivery' target="_blank">Progressive Delivery</Link>
Deploy into production environments safely using canary, blue/green and A/B
strategies. Simple single file configuration defines success / rollback SLO
using observability metrics from Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic and others.

### :infinity: <Link to='../pipelines/intro' target="_blank">CD Pipelines</Link>
Rollout new software from development to production.
Environment rollouts that work with your existing CI system.

### :factory_worker::female-factory-worker: <Link to='../workspaces/intro' target="_blank">Team Workspaces</Link>

Total RBAC control and policy enforcement with integration to enterprise IAM.

### :point_up_2: <Link to='../gitops-templates/intro' target="_blank">Self-Service Templates and Profiles</Link>
Component profiles enable teams to deploy standard services quickly,
consistently and reliably. Teams can curate the profiles that are available
within their estate ensuring there is consistency everywhere. Using GitOps
it's easy to guarantee the latest, secure versions of any component are
deployed in all production systems.

### :sparkling_heart: Health Status and Compliance Dashboards
Gain a single view of the health and state of the cluster and its workloads.
Monitor deployments and alert on policy violations across apps and clusters.
