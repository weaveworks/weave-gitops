<AlphaWarning/>

As platform engineer you could need to have a finer understanding on the underlying logic for Explorer. The following
options are available to you to operate and troubleshoot it.

## Debug Access Rules

It is a debugging tool to make visible explorer authorization logic. You could find it as tab `Access Rules`  alongside
the `Query` tab.

You could discover by `Cluster` and `Subject` the `Kinds` it is allowed to read. These are the rules that
will be the source of truth doing authorization when a user does a query.

## Monitoring

Explorer provides the following telemetry to use for operations.

### Metrics

Explorer exports [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics. See [setup](../../operations/monitoring#setup) to get started.

#### Querying

Explorer querying path is composed of three components exporting metrics:

- API server
- Datastore Reads
- Indexer Reads

##### API Server

Based on [go-http-metrics](https://github.com/slok/go-http-metrics/blob/master/metrics/prometheus/prometheus.go), the following
metrics are generated.

**Request Duration:** histogram with the latency of the HTTP requests.

```
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="/v1/query",method="POST",le="0.05"} 0
http_request_duration_seconds_sum{handler="/v1/query",method="POST"} 10.088081923
http_request_duration_seconds_count{handler="/v1/query",method="POST"} 51
```

**Response Size:** histogram with the size of the HTTP responses in bytes

```
http_response_size_bytes_bucket{handler="/v1/query",method="POST",le="0.05"} 10
http_response_size_bytes_sum{handler="/v1/query",method="POST"} 120
http_response_size_bytes_count{handler="/v1/query",method="POST"} 10
```

**Requests In Flight:** gauge with the number of inflight requests being handled at the same time.

```
http_requests_inflight{handler="/v1/query"} 0
```

##### Datastore Reads

**Request Latency:** histogram with the latency of the datastore read requests.

- `action` is the datastore read operation that could be either `GetObjects`, `GetAccessRules`, `GetObjectByID`, `GetRoles` or `GetRoleBindings`.
- `status` is the result of the operation. It could be either  read operation that could be either `success` or `error`.

```
datastore_latency_seconds_bucket{action="GetObjectByID", le="+Inf", status="success"} 1175
datastore_latency_seconds_bucket{action="GetObjectByID", le="0.01", status="success"} 1174
```
```
datastore_latency_seconds_count{action="GetObjectByID",  status="success"} 1175
datastore_latency_seconds_count{action="GetRoleBindings",  status="success"} 47
datastore_latency_seconds_count{action="GetRoles",  status="success"} 47
```
```
datastore_latency_seconds_sum{action="GetObjectByID",  status="success"} 0.6924557999999995
datastore_latency_seconds_sum{action="GetRoleBindings",  status="success"} 1.329158916
datastore_latency_seconds_sum{action="GetRoles",  status="success"} 3.942473879999999
```

**Requests In Flight:** gauge with the number of inflight requests being handled at the same time.

- `action` is the datastore read operation that could be either `GetObjects`, `GetAccessRules`, `GetObjectByID`, `GetRoles` or `GetRoleBindings`

```
datastore_inflight_requests{action="GetObjectByID"} 0
datastore_inflight_requests{action="GetRoleBindings"} 0
datastore_inflight_requests{action="GetRoles"} 0
```

##### Indexer Reads

**Request Latency:** histogram with the latency of the indexer read requests.

- `action` is the index read operation that could be either `ListFacets` or `Search`
- `status` is the result of the operation. It could be either  read operation that could be either `success` or `error`

```
indexer_latency_seconds_bucket{action="ListFacets", le="+Inf", status="success"} 1
indexer_latency_seconds_bucket{action="Search", le="+Inf", status="success"} 47
```
```
indexer_latency_seconds_sum{action="ListFacets", status="success"} 0.008928666
indexer_latency_seconds_sum{action="Search", status="success"} 0.06231312599999999
```
```
indexer_latency_seconds_count{action="ListFacets", status="success"} 1
indexer_latency_seconds_count{action="Search", status="success"} 47
```

**Requests In Flight:** gauge with the number of inflight requests being handled at the same time.

- `action` is the index read operation that could be either `ListFacets` or `Search`

```
indexer_inflight_requests{action="ListFacets"} 0
indexer_inflight_requests{action="Search"} 0
```

#### Collecting

Explorer collecting path is composed of three components exporting metrics:

- Cluster Watcher Manager
- Datastore Writes
- Indexer Writes

The following metrics are available to monitor its health.

##### Cluster Watcher

The metric `collector_cluster_watcher` provides the number of the cluster watchers it the following `status`:
- Starting: a cluster watcher is starting at the back of detecting that a new cluster has been registered.
- Started: cluster watcher has been started and collecting events from the remote cluster. This is the stable state.
- Stopping: a cluster has been deregistered so its cluster watcher is no longer required. In the process of stopping it.
- Failed: a cluster watcher has failed during the creation or starting process and cannot collect events from the remote clusters. This is the unstable state.

Where `collector` is the type of collector, it could be
- rbac: for collecting RBAC resources (ie roles)
- objects: for collecting non-rbac resources (ie kustomizations)

```
collector_cluster_watcher{collector="objects", status="started"} 1
collector_cluster_watcher{collector="objects", status="starting"} 0
collector_cluster_watcher{collector="rbac", status="started"} 1
collector_cluster_watcher{collector="rbac", status="starting"} 0
```

A sum on `collector_cluster_watcher` gives the total number of cluster watchers that should be equal to the number of clusters

##### Datastore Writes

**Request Latency:** histogram with the latency of the datastore write requests.

- `action` is the datastore write operation that could be either `StoreRoles`, `StoreRoleBindings`, `StoreObjects`, `DeleteObjects`,
`DeleteAllObjects`, `DeleteRoles`, `DeleteAllRoles`, `DeleteRoleBindings`, `DeleteAllRoleBindings`
- `status` is the result of the operation. It could be either  read operation that could be either `success` or `error`

```
datastore_latency_seconds_bucket{action="StoreRoles", le="+Inf", status="success"} 1175
datastore_latency_seconds_bucket{action="StoreRoles", le="0.01", status="success"} 1174
```

```
datastore_latency_seconds_count{action="StoreRoles",  status="success"} 1175
datastore_latency_seconds_count{action="DeleteRoles",  status="success"} 47
datastore_latency_seconds_count{action="DeleteAllRoleBindings",  status="success"} 47
```

```
datastore_latency_seconds_sum{action="StoreRoles",  status="success"} 0.6924557999999995
datastore_latency_seconds_sum{action="DeleteRoles",  status="success"} 1.329158916
datastore_latency_seconds_sum{action="DeleteAllRoleBindings",  status="success"} 3.942473879999999
```

**Requests In Flight:** gauge with the number of inflight write requests being handled at the same time.

- `action` is the datastore write operation that could be either `StoreRoles`, `StoreRoleBindings`, `StoreObjects`, `DeleteObjects`,
`DeleteAllObjects`, `DeleteRoles`, `DeleteAllRoles`, `DeleteRoleBindings`, `DeleteAllRoleBindings`

```
datastore_inflight_requests{action="StoreRoles"} 0
datastore_inflight_requests{action="StoreRoleBindings"} 0
datastore_inflight_requests{action="DeleteAllRoleBindings"} 0
```

##### Indexer Writes

**Request Latency:** histogram with the latency of the indexer write requests.

- `action` is the index write operation that could be either `Add`, `Remove` or `RemoveByQuery`
- `status` is the result of the operation. It could be either `success` or `error`

```

```
```
