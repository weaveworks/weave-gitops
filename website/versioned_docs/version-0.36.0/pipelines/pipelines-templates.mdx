# Using GitOpsTemplates for Pipelines <TierLabel tiers="Enterprise" />

To create new Pipelines and their required resources from within Weave GitOps
Enterprise, you can leverage [GitOpsTemplates](../gitops-templates/intro.mdx), which help platform teams scale for developer self-service.

This document provides example configuration that you can adapt and use within your own organization, based on your [tenancy model](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/15/three-tenancy-models-for-kubernetes/).

We will cover the creation of:
- Pipelines
- Alerts
- Providers

Secrets, required for authentication and authorization between leaf and management clusters as well as to Git, are out of scope for this document and must be handled by your chosen secret management solution.

For advice on Secrets Management, refer to [the Flux guide](https://fluxcd.io/flux/security/secrets-management/).

Templates can include a single resource or multiple resources, depending on your use case. For example, you may want to only create the Pipeline custom resource to associate existing HelmReleases. Or, you can create the HelmReleases, notification controller resources, and Pipeline all in a single template. They are highly customizable to meet the needs of your teams.

## Adding New Resources From Within the Weave GitOps Enterprise Dashboard

GitOpsTemplates are custom resources installed onto a management cluster where Weave GitOps Enterprise resides. To add a new Pipeline, click `Create a Pipeline` from within the Pipeline view. This will take you to a pre-filtered list of templates with the label: `weave.works/template-type: pipeline`.

![Create Pipeline button in Pipeline view](img/pipelines-table-create.png)

 The `Templates` view (shown below) lists all templates for which a given user has the appropriate permission to view. You can install GitOpsTemplates into different namespaces and apply standard Kubernetes RBAC to limit which teams can utilize which templates. You can also configure [policy](../../policy/intro) to enforce permitted values within a template.

## Example: GitOpsTemplates

This section provides examples to help you build your own templates for Pipelines.

### Pipeline: Visualization Only

:::tip Included Sample
This default template is shipped with Weave GitOps Enterprise to help you get started with Pipelines.
:::

For flexibility, this allows the template user to specify the names of the clusters where the application is deployed, and to vary the namespace per cluster. This works even in a tenancy model where environments coexist on the same cluster and use namespaces for isolation.

### Pipeline - Multi-Cluster Promotion

This example extends the above to add a promotion strategy. In this case, it will raise a pull request to update the application version in subsequent environments.

```

#### Git Credentials

For guidance on configuring credentials, find instructions in the [Promoting Applications](../promoting-applications#create-credentials-secret) documentation.

#### Promotion Marker Added to HelmRelease in `Second-Environment`

You must add a comment to the HelmRelease or Kustomization patch where the `spec.chart.spec.version` is defined. For example, if the values used in the above template were as follows:

```yaml
RESOURCE_NAME=my-app
RESOURCE_NAMESPACE=pipeline-01
```

Then the marker would be:

```yaml
# {"$promotion": "pipeline-01:my-app:Second-Environment"}
```

Find more guidance on adding markers [here](../promoting-applications#add-markers-to-app-manifests).

### Alerts and Providers

This example shows you how you can configure multiple resources in a single template and simplify creation through common naming strategies. The notification controller communicates update events from the leaf clusters where applications are deployed to the management cluster, where the Pipeline Controller resides and orchestrates.

For the `Alert`, this template filters events to detect when an update has occurred. Depending on your use case, you can use different filtering.

For the `Provider`, this template uses authenticated (HMAC) communication to the promotion endpoint, where a secret must be present on both the management cluster and the leaf cluster(s). For simplicity's sake, you can use a `generic` provider instead; this will not require the secret.

## Summary

GitOpsTemplates provide a highly flexible way for platform and application teams to work together with Pipelines.

You can hard-code values, offer a range of accepted values, or allow the template consumer to provide input based on your organization's requirements.

Templates are subject to RBAC as with any Kubernetes resource, enabling you to easily control which tenants have access to which templates.

For full details on GitOpsTemplates, read our [documentation](../gitops-templates/intro.mdx).
