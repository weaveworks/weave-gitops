To view pipelines, users need read access to the `pipeline` resource and the underlying `application` resources. This sample configuration shows a recommended way to configure RBAC to provide such access. The `pipeline-reader` role and the `search-pipeline-reader`
role-binding allow a group `search-developer` to access pipeline resources within the `search` namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: pipeline-reader
rules:
  - apiGroups: [ "pipelines.weave.works" ]
    resources: [ "pipelines" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: ["helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "helmreleases" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch"]
