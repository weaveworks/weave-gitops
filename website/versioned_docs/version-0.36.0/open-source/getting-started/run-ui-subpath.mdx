title: "Optional: Running the UI on a Subpath"
---

## Running the UI on a subpath

By default, the UI is served on the root path `/`. It is possible to run the UI on a subpath, for example `/weave-gitops`.
This is useful if you want to run weave-gitops alongside other applications on the same domain.

To run the UI on a subpath, you need to set the `--route-prefix` flag on the weave-gitops server.
For example, if you want to run the UI on `/weave-gitops`, you can set the flag to `--route-prefix=/weave-gitops`.

To set the flag we use the `additionalArgs` field in the `spec.values` section of the weave-gitops `HelmRelease`.

```yaml
spec:
  values:
    additionalArgs:
      - --route-prefix=/weave-gitops
```

## Ingress

`Ingress` is a Kubernetes resource that allows you to expose your application to the internet.
Please refer to the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
for more information about a complete `Ingress` configuration. It often depends on the Kubernetes provider you are
using and your particular setup.

The Weave GitOps Helm chart can generate an `Ingress` resource to integrate with the ingress controller you have configured for your cluster.
To enable ingress generation set the `ingress.enabled` field to `true`.

- If you are running the UI on a subpath, you need to set the `path` field to the same subpath specified in the `--route-prefix` flag.
- If you have not set a subpath on the weave-gitops server, set the path in the ingress configration to `/`.

```yaml
spec:
  values:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      hosts:
      - host: ""
        paths:
        - path: /wego # set the path to `/` if you have not set the `--route-prefix` flag 
          pathType: Prefix
```

See the [Helm chart reference](../../references/helm-reference.md) for a list of all supported ingress options.
