# Get Started with the Terraform Controller

## Preflight Checks

To set up the [Terraform Controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller) (TF-Controller), follow the steps in the preflight checks. Here is a summary of what you will need to do:

  1. Install Flux **v0.32.0** or later on your cluster. This includes installing the Flux CLI on your local machine and installing the Flux controllers on the cluster.
  2. Configure the network firewall or security groups on your cluster to allow incoming connections to **port 30000** on **each Runner's Pod in each namespace**.
     This will allow the Controller to communicate with the Runner's Pod via gRPC.
  3. Configure the network firewall or security groups on your cluster to allow the Controller to download tar.gz BLOBs **from the Source controller** via **port 80** and
     to post events to **the Notification controller** via **port 80**.

The exact steps for setting up the TF-controller will depend on the specific environment
and infrastructure that you are using. The [project's documentation](https://weaveworks.github.io/tf-controller/) provides additional information to help with setup.

## Setup

Perform the following actions to set up TF-Controller:

1. Create a local cluster using a tool such as `kind` or `minikube`. This will allow you to develop and test TF-Controller in a local environment before deploying it to a production cluster.
   ```bash
   kind create cluster --name tf-controller
   ```

2. Install the Flux CLI on your local machine. This will allow you to interact with the Flux controllers on your cluster.
   ```bash
   brew install fluxcd/tap/flux
   ```

3. Prepare a Git repository to store the configuration files and manifests for Flux and TF-controller. For this example we'll use GitHub. To follow along, you'll need a GitHub account and [personal access token with repo permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens). You'll also need to properly configure your Git client by [setting your username](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer) and [email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-email-address-for-every-repository-on-your-computer). 

Assuming your username is `$GITHUB_USER`, you can create a new repository called `gitops-tf-controller` using the following command:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_USER=<your github username>
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your github personal access token>

   gh repo create $GITHUB_USER/gitops-tf-controller
   ```

4. Bootstrap the cluster with Flux v2 (v0.32.0 or later) using the path (for example) `./cluster/my-cluster`. This will install Flux on the cluster and create a Flux system at `./cluster/my-cluster/flux-system`.
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:$GITHUB_USER/gitops-tf-controller.git
   cd gitops-tf-controller

   flux bootstrap github \
     --owner=$GITHUB_USER \
     --repository=gitops-tf-controller \
     --branch=main \
      --path=./cluster/my-cluster \
      --personal \
      --token-auth
    ```

5. Create a directory at `./cluster/my-cluster/infra/`:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ./cluster/my-cluster/infra/
    ```

Download the TF-controller manifest from [the release location](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/main/docs/release.yaml)
    and save it to `./cluster/my-cluster/infra/tf-controller.yaml`—placing the file `tf-controller.yaml` in this directory:

    ```bash
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/main/docs/release.yaml > ./cluster/my-cluster/infra/tf-controller.yaml
    ```
Add the manifest file to the Git repository, then push the changes to your repository.

6. In the same directory, create a `kustomization.yaml` file that contains the following:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    resources:
      - tf-controller.yaml
    ```
Add the `kustomization.yaml` file to your Git repository, then push the changes to your repository.

If you want to use TF-Controller with the Notification Controller,
you will also need to modify the manifest to enable the two controllers to work together.
The exact steps for doing this will depend on the specific requirements of your environment and the configuration of the Notification Controller.
You may need to refer to [the documentation for the TF-Controller and Notification Controller](https://fluxcd.io/flux/cheatsheets/bootstrap/#enable-notifications-for-third-party-controllers) for more information on how to set this up.

## Other Installation Methods

Before using TF-Controller, you must install Flux by using either `flux install` or the `flux bootstrap` command.
Make sure you have the latest version of Flux. After that, you can install TF-controller with Flux HelmRelease with this command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/main/docs/release.yaml
```

For the most recent TF-Controller release candidate, please use [rc.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/main/docs/rc.yaml):

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/main/docs/rc.yaml
```

or manually with Helm by:

```shell
# Add tf-controller helm repository
helm repo add tf-controller https://weaveworks.github.io/tf-controller/

# Install tf-controller
helm upgrade -i tf-controller tf-controller/tf-controller \
    --namespace flux-system
```

For details on configurable parameters of the TF-controller chart,
please see [this chart Readme](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/tree/main/charts/tf-controller#tf-controller-for-flux).

Alternatively, you can install TF-controller via `kubectl`:

```shell
export TF_CON_VER=v0.14.0
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/releases/download/${TF_CON_VER}/tf-controller.crds.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/releases/download/${TF_CON_VER}/tf-controller.rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/releases/download/${TF_CON_VER}/tf-controller.deployment.yaml
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to GitOps your Terraform resources with TF-controller and Flux.

### Define Source

First, define a Source controller's source (`GitRepository`, `Bucket`, `OCIRepository`)—for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: helloworld
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 30s
  url: https://github.com/tf-controller/helloworld
  ref:
    branch: main
```

### The GitOps Automation Mode

In this mode, Terraform resources will be planned and automatically applied for you. Enable it by setting `.spec.approvePlan=auto`: 

```yaml
apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha2
kind: Terraform
metadata:
  name: helloworld
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 1m
  approvePlan: auto
  path: ./
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: helloworld
    namespace: flux-system
```

For a full list of features and how to use them, please visit the [Terraform overview](../terraform-intro).

### Troubleshooting

#### Getting a `drift detected` event message when it's a change of source that triggered the update

Whenever you change a source, you will get a new plan. TF-controller picks up the new plan and applies it. Drift happens if, and only if, the live system changes intentionally. Then TF-controller will generate a lengthy message [see an example](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/issues/890#issuecomment-1691610117) stating that a drift has occurred. If there is drift, the icon will be red in the TF Objects > Status column of the WGE UI.

## Other Examples
  * A Terraform GitOps with Flux to automatically reconcile your [AWS IAM Policies](https://github.com/tf-controller/aws-iam-policies).
  * GitOps an existing EKS cluster by partially importing its nodegroup and managing it with TF-controller: [An EKS scaling example](https://github.com/tf-controller/eks-scaling).
