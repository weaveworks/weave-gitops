This guide shows you the basics steps to start using Explorer.

## Pre-requisites

Before using Explorer, please ensure that:

- You have Weave Gitops Enterprise [v0.23.0 or later version](../enterprise/getting-started/releases-enterprise.mdx)
- You have deployed an application.

## Setup

Explorer is enabled via configuration through the feature flag  `enableExplorer` that you could
configure in your Weave Gitops Enterprise HelmRelease values:


```yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: weave-gitops-enterprise
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  # ... other spec components
  values:
    enableExplorer: true
```

For a complete overview on the configuration you could see [configuration](./configuration.mdx).

## Explorer UI

Login to Weave Gitops and Explorer will be shown in the navigation menu `Explorer`.

Explorer UI looks as follows:

![explorer](imgs/explorer-open-new.png)

It has two main components:

- A search dialog with filter to querying the platform resources
- A table with the filtered resources.

For a more detailed view on the UI you could see [querying](./querying.mdx).
