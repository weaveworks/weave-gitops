As [wikipedia defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery), Continuous delivery is

>a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles,
>ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, without doing so manually.
>It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency.

>Continuous delivery is enabled through the deployment pipeline.
>The purpose of the deployment pipeline has three components: visibility, feedback, and continually deploy.

Weave GitOps Enterprise Pipelines allows you to define your deployment pipelines to enable continuous delivery for
your gitops applications.

As part of Weave GitOps Enterprise, you can

- [Define a delivery pipeline](../pipelines-getting-started/#define-a-pipeline) for an application that is packaged as a Helm chart.
- [Visualise a pipeline](../pipelines-getting-started/#view-pipeline-list) and check the current status and versions of your deployments.
- [Promote applications](../promoting-applications) either automatically or manually via the Weave GitOps Enterprise dashboard.
- Notify other CI tools such as [Tekton](../pipelines-with-tekton) and [Jenkins](../pipelines-with-jenkins) of an application promotion.


Now that you know what delivery pipelines can do for you, follow the [guide to get started](../pipelines-getting-started).
