Built upon the core tenets of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), [progressive delivery](https://www.weave.works/blog/progressive-delivery-checklist) involves gradually rolling out features to small groups of select users to balance performance with speed. Developers and DevOps teams use fine-grained controls to minimize the risks of pushing new features to the production environment. If the newly released feature proves to be stable and performant, it can then be released to all users.

[Flagger](https://docs.flagger.app/) is a progressive delivery operator for Kubernetes and part of the Flux family of open source projects. It reduces the risk of introducing new software versions and automates production releases to improve your time to delivery. Flagger implements deployment strategies—canary releases, A/B testing, Blue/Green mirroring—using a service mesh (App Mesh, Istio, Linkerd, Kuma, Open Service Mesh) or an ingress controller (Contour, Gloo, NGINX, Skipper, Traefik, APISIX) for traffic routing. For release analysis, Flagger can query Prometheus, InfluxDB, Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch, Stackdriver, or Graphite. For alerting it uses Slack, MS Teams, Discord, and Rocket. Using Flux allows us to manage our cluster applications in a declarative way through changes in a Git repository.

Weave GitOps Enterprise integrates with Flagger in order to provide a view on progressive delivery deployments. This includes the ability to view all the resources that Flagger manages during its operation. The default ClusterRole `gitops-canaries-reader` includes the minimum permissions necessary for a user to be able to view canary object details, metric template object details and canary related events. 

The WGE UI's Applications > Delivery view provides an "at a glance" view so that you can understand the status of your progressive delivery rollouts across a fleet of connected clusters. This removes the cognitive overhead of having to know which objects to query and where they are located. You can also drill down into each rollout to understand its status and configuration, and view near-to-realtime data on any summary or details page.

![Applications Delivery view](/img/dashboard-applications-delivery.png)

How to use WGE's progressive delivery offering:
- if you don’t have Flagger installed on any clusters, you'll receive an onboarding message about installing it
- click on the delivery tab on the menu bar to retrieve a table view of canaries with key summary information regarding their location and state
- click on a canary to see more detailed information about status, gates, and other elements
- click on the events tab on the detail page to see the most recent Kubernetes events for that canary and learn more about deployment history
- click on the yaml tab on the detail page to see the raw yaml of the canary
- view objects from any cluster/namespace that you have the appropriate permissions for, and nothing else

Supported deployment strategies include:
 
![canary release icon](/img/canary.svg)  **Canary Release**: the system gradually shifts traffic to
a new version of an application and assesses performance—either promoting the release or abandoning it, based on performance.

![a b testing icon](/img/ab.svg)  **A/B Testing**: uses HTTP headers or cookies to ensure users remain on the same version of an application during a canary analysis.

![blue green testing icon](/img/blue-green.svg)  **Blue/Green**: Traffic is switched from the current application to a new version based on the success of testing.

![blue green mirroring icon](/img/mirroring.svg)  **Blue/Green with Traffic Mirroring**: sends copies of incoming requests to the new version of an application. The user receives the response from the current application and the other is discarded. The new version is promoted only if metrics are healthy.

This guide uses Flux manifests to install Flagger and [Linkerd](https://github.com/linkerd), a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) project and service mesh for Kubernetes and beyond. We will walk you through a full end-to-end scenario where you will:
- [Install the Linkerd service mesh](#installing-linkerd-using-flux)
- [Install Flagger](#installing-flagger-using-flux)
- [Deploy a sample application using a canary release strategy based on metrics provided through
  Linkerd's in-built Prometheus instance](#deploy-a-canary-release)

## Prerequisites
- This guide assumes you already have a Kubernetes cluster running and have [bootstrapped Flux](https://fluxcd.io/docs/get-started/). To apply the manifests listed here, you will need to commit them to a repository being reconciled with Flux.
- Flagger requires the [`autoscaling/v2`](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/tree/master/autoscaling/v2) or [`autoscaling/v2beta2`](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/tree/master/autoscaling/v2beta2) API to be installed on your cluster. You can use `kubectl api-resources` to check which API versions are supported.
- The [step](https://smallstep.com/cli/) CLI installed to generate certificates that support mTLS connections.

## Installing Linkerd Using Flux

To install Linkerd we'll use a Kustomization file. It will allow us to specify the order and default namespace for the installed resources, and to generate Secrets from certificate files via the use of a `secretGenerator`.

To support mTLS connections between meshed pods, Linkerd requires a trust anchor
certificate and an issuer certificate with its corresponding key. These certificates are
automatically created via the `linkerd install` command. However, when using a Helm chart to
install Linkerd, you must provide these certificates deliberately. The `step` CLI, listed above, allows us to generate these
certificates.

To generate the trust anchor certificate, run:
```bash
step certificate create root.linkerd.cluster.local ca.crt ca.key \
--profile root-ca --no-password --insecure
```

To generate the issuer certificate, run:
```bash
step certificate create identity.linkerd.cluster.local issuer.crt issuer.key \
--profile intermediate-ca --not-after 8760h --no-password --insecure \
--ca ca.crt --ca-key ca.key
```

Add the `ca.crt`, `issuer.crt`, and `issuer.key` files to the cluster repository under a `linkerd`
directory.

Let's add the three manifests for Linkerd components under the `./linkerd` directory:
- A `Namespace` resource to control where the components are installed
- A `HelmRepository` resource to make the Linkerd Helm repo available on the
	cluster
- A `HelmRelease` resource to install the latest version of Linkerd from the
	`HelmRepository`

:::tip
The value for the `spec.values.identity.issuer.crtExpiry` field below depends on the parameter value
used during the creation of the issuer certificate. In this example, it should be set to
one year from the certificate creation.

        name: linkerd
```

</details>

Next, add the following manifests. The first file instructs Kustomize to patch any `Secrets` that are referenced in
`HelmRelease` manifests. The second file is a `Kustomization` that references all the
other `linkerd` resource files.

<details><summary>Expand to see the Linkerd Kustomization manifests</summary>

      - issuer.crt
      - issuer.key
```

:::info Note
The `secretGenerator` generates Secrets from the files you've just created.
:::

</details>

At this point the `linkerd` directory in your cluster repository should look like this:

```bash
> tree linkerd
linkerd
├── ca.crt
├── issuer.crt
├── issuer.key
├── kustomization.yaml
├── kustomizeconfig.yaml
├── namespace.yaml
├── releases.yaml
└── source.yaml
```

Once Flux reconciles this directory to the cluster, Linkerd should be installed.

Before proceeding to the next step, check that all the Linkerd pods have started successfully:

```bash
> kubectl get pods -n linkerd

:::info Note
Any new directories that you add to the cluster repository while following this guide must 
be included in a path that Flux reconciles.

## Installing Flagger Using Flux

To install Flagger, you'll use a Kustomization file that will define the installation order and
provide a default namespace for the installed resources.

Create a new `flagger` directory. Make sure to locate it under a repository path that Flux reconciles. 

Now add under this directory the three resource manifests for Flagger:
- A `Namespace` resource to control where the components are installed
- A `HelmRepository` resource to make the Flagger Helm repo available on the
	cluster
- A `HelmRelease` resource to install the latest version of Flagger and the load
	tester app (which generates synthetic traffic during the
	analysis phase), from that `HelmRepository`

<details><summary>Expand to see the three Flagger resource manifests</summary>

```yaml title="flagger/namespace.yaml"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace

```

```yaml title="flagger/source.yaml"
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2

```

```yaml title="flagger/releases.yaml"

      reconcileStrategy: ChartVersion
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: flagger
```

</details>

Now add the following Kustomization file. It references all of the previous files that you've
added:

<details><summary>Expand to see the Flagger Kustomization manifest</summary>

```yaml title="flagger/kustomization.yaml"
---
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: flagger
resources:
- namespace.yaml
- source.yaml
- releases.yaml
```

</details>

The `flagger` directory in the cluster repository should look like this:

```bash
> tree flagger
flagger
├── kustomization.yaml
├── namespace.yaml
├── releases.yaml
└── source.yaml
```

Once Flux reconciles this directory to the cluster, Flagger and the load tester app should be
installed.

Before proceeding to the next step, check that all of your Flagger pods have started successfully:

```bash
> kubectl get pods -n flagger
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
flagger-7d456d4fc7-knf2g      1/1     Running   0          4m
loadtester-855b4d77f6-scl6r   1/1     Running   0          4m
```

## Custom Resources Generated by Flagger

When Flagger is configured to integrate with a service mesh such as Linkerd or Istio for the rollout, this ClusterRole needs to be extended so that it can read the additional service mesh resources that Flagger generates. To display service mesh- or ingress-related resources, we require `spec.provider` to be set in each canary resource. 

The following table provides a list of all the custom resources that Flagger generates grouped by provider:

| Provider          | API Group                 | Resource        |
| ---               | ---                       | ---             |
| AppMesh           | appmesh.k8s.aws           | virtualnode     |
|                   | appmesh.k8s.aws           | virtualrouter   |
|                   | appmesh.k8s.aws           | virtualservice  |
| Linkerd           | split.smi-spec.io         | trafficsplit    |
| Istio             | networking.istio.io       | destinationrule |
|                   | networking.istio.io       | virtualservice  |
| Contour           | projectcontour.io         | httpproxy       |
| Gloo              | gateway.solo.io           | routetable      |
|                   | gloo.solo.io              | upstream        |
| Nginx             | networking.k8s.io         | ingress         |
| Skipper           | networking.k8s.io         | ingress         |
| Traefik           | traefik.containo.us       | traefikservice  |
| Open Service Mesh | split.smi-spec.io         | trafficsplit    |
| Kuma              | kuma.io                   | trafficroute    |
| GatewayAPI        | gateway.networking.k8s.io | httproute       |

For example, the following manifest shows how `gitops-canaries-reader` has been extended to allow the user for viewing TrafficSplit resources when Linkerd is used:

<details><summary>Expand to see example canary reader RBAC</summary>

```yaml title="gitops-canaries-reader.yaml"

# Additional permissions for Linkerd resources are added below

  verbs:

  - list
```

</details>

## Setting up Remote Cluster Permissions

In order to view canaries in a remote cluster from the management cluster, you need to consider the following:
- The service account used to access the remote cluster needs to be able to list namespaces and custom resource definitions in the given cluster. It additionally needs to be able to impersonate users and groups.
- The user or group that logs in to the management cluster, needs appropriate permissions to certain resources of the remote cluster.

For example, applying the following manifest on remote clusters, ensures that the `wego-admin` user will be able to view canary information from within the Weave GitOps Enterprise UI on the management cluster:

<details><summary>Expand to see example of remote cluster canary reader</summary>

```

</details>

You may need to add more users/groups to the `read-canaries` ClusterRoleBinding to ensure additional users can view canary information from within the Weave GitOps Enterprise UI.

## Deploy a Canary Release

To demonstrate the progressive rollout of an application, we'll use a tiny sample web app called
[podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) and configure a [canary release
strategy](https://docs.flagger.app/usage/deployment-strategies#canary-release). 

In our example, Flagger will scale up a new version of podinfo (the canary) alongside the existing version (the
primary). It will gradually increase traffic to the new version in increments of 5%, up to a maximum of
50%. Flagger will continuously monitor the new version for an acceptable request response rate and
average request duration. Based on this analysis, Flagger will either update the primary to the new
version or abandon the promotion, then scale the canary back down to zero.

Create a new `test` directory and add these three canary resource manifests under it:
- A `Namespace` resource to control where the components are installed
- A `Deployment` and `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` for the `podinfo` application
- A `Canary` resource which references the `Deployment` and `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` resources

We don't need to define a service resource. This is specified within the canary definition and created by Flagger.

Add a Kustomization file to apply all resources to the `test` namespace:

<details><summary>Expand to see the Canary Kustomization manifest</summary>

```yaml title="test/kustomization.yaml"
---
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: test
resources:
- namespace.yaml
- deployment.yaml
- canary.yaml
```

</details>

At this point, the `test` directory in the cluster repository should look like this:

```bash
> tree test
test
├── canary.yaml
├── deployment.yaml
├── kustomization.yaml
└── namespace.yaml
```

After a short time, the status of the canary object should be set to `Initialized`:

![Canary rollout initialized](/img/pd-details-initialized.png)

```bash
> kubectl get canary podinfo -n test
NAME      STATUS        WEIGHT   LASTTRANSITIONTIME
podinfo   Initialized   0        2022-07-22T12:37:58Z
```

Trigger a new rollout by bumping the version of `podinfo`:

```bash
> kubectl set image deployment/podinfo podinfod=ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo:6.0.1 -n test
```

During the progressive rollout, the canary object reports on its current status:


![Canary rollout progressing](/img/pd-details-progressing.png)

```bash
> kubectl get canary podinfo -n test
NAME      STATUS        WEIGHT   LASTTRANSITIONTIME
podinfo   Progressing   5       2022-07-22T12:41:57Z
```

After a short time the rollout is completed and the status of the canary object is set to
`Succeeded`:

![Canary rollout succeeded](/img/pd-details-succeeded.png)

```bash
> kubectl get canary podinfo -n test
NAME      STATUS      WEIGHT   LASTTRANSITIONTIME
podinfo   Succeeded   0        2022-07-22T12:47:58Z
```

## Summary
