## Policy CRD
The Policy CRD is used to define policies which are then consumed and used by the agent to validate entities.

It uses [OPA Rego Language](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language) to evaluate the entities.

## Policy Library

You should have a policy library repo set up which includes your policies resources as CRDs.

:::info
Enterprise customers should have access to fork policy library repo into their local repositories.

## Tenant Policy

Tenant policies are special policies that are used by the [Multi Tenancy](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/enterprise/multi-tenancy/) feature in [Weave GitOps Enterprise](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/intro-ee/)

Tenant policies have a special tag `tenancy`.


## Mutating Resources

Starting from version `v2.2.0`, the policy agent will support mutating resources.

To enable mutating resources, policies must have field `mutate` set to `true` and the rego code should return the `violating_key` and the `recommended_value` in the violation response. The mutation webhook will use the `violating_key` and `recommended_value` to mutate the resource and return the new mutated resource.

Example

```
result = {
    "issue_detected": true,
    "msg": sprintf("Replica count must be greater than or equal to '%v'; found '%v'.", [min_replica_count, replicas]),
    "violating_key": "spec.replicas",
    "recommended_value": min_replica_count
}
```


## Policy Validation

The policy validation object is the result of validating an entity against a policy. It contains all the necessary information to give the user a clear idea on what caused this violation or compliance.

```yaml
id: string # identifier for the violation
account_id: string # organization identifier
cluster_id: string # cluster identifier
policy: object # contains related policy data
entity: object # contains related resource data
status: string # Violation or Compliance
message: string # message that summarizes the policy validation
type: string # the mode that produced this object. one of: Admission, Audit, TFAdmission
trigger: string # what triggered the validation, create request or initial audit,..
created_at: string # time that the validation occurred in
```
