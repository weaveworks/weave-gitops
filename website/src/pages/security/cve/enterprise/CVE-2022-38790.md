# Malicious links can be crafted by users and shown in the UI

## Impact
Unpatched versions of Weave GitOps Enterprise are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug allowing a malicious user to inject a javascript: link in the UI. When clicked by a victim user, the script will execute with the victim's permission.

The exposure appears in Weave GitOps Enterprise UI via a GitopsCluster dashboard link. An annotation can be added to a GitopsCluster custom resource.

```yaml
apiVersion: gitops.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitopsCluster
metadata:
  name: demo-02
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    metadata.weave.works/dashboard.hellothere: "javascript:alert('hello there ' + window.localStorage.getItem('name'));"
```

The attacker does not need access to the Weave GitOps UI to craft an attack. It could be crafted by modifying the resources via 
Git repository or Kubernetes API.  

## Patches

[v0.9.0-rc.5](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops-enterprise/releases/tag/v0.9.0-rc.5)

## Workarounds

Given that the exposure comes from modifications done in `GitopsCluster` objects, the mitigation comes around establishing the controls to avoid that an attacker could modify them.

1.  Via Git, by ensuring that no modifications to `GitopsCluster` are done without review or control that avoids it.
2. Via Kubernetes API, by ensuring that access to `GitopsCluster` resources is properly protected [via RBAC](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/next/configuration/recommended-rbac-configuration/).
