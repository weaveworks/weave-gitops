Weave GitOps Enterprise helps you understand the state of progressive delivery 
updates to your applications with [Flagger](https://flagger.app). The Delivery 
view shows all your deployed `Canary` objects and the status for how a rollout 
is progressing. 

By default, Flagger will automatically promote a new version of an application 
should it pass the defined checks during an analysis phase. However, you can 
also configure [webhooks](https://docs.flagger.app/usage/webhooks) to enable 
manual approvals for Flagger to proceed to the next phase of a rollout.

In this guide we will show you how to get started with manually gating a 
progressive delivery promotion with Flagger, using the in-built load tester as 
a way to demonstrate and learn the capability so that you could configure 
your own gates.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic knowledge of [Flagger](https://flagger.app).
- An existing `Canary` object and target deployment.
- Flagger's load tester [installed](https://docs.flagger.app/usage/webhooks#load-testing)

## Basic introduction to Webhooks and Gating
Flagger can be configured to work with several types of hooks which will be called at 
given stages during a progressive delivery rollout. Some of these allow you to manually 
gate whether a rollout proceeds at certain points:
- Before a new deployment is scaled up and canary analysis begins with `confirm-rollout`. 
- Before traffic weight is increased with `confirm-traffic-increase`.
- Before a new version is promoted following successful canary analysis with `confirm-promotion`.

Any URL can be used as a webhook target, if will approve if it returns with a
`200 OK` status code, and halt if it's `403 Forbidden`.

The webhook will receive a JSON payload that can be unmarshaled as
`CanaryWebhookPayload`:

```go
type CanaryWebhookPayload struct {
	// Name of the canary
	Name string `json:"name"`

	// Namespace of the canary
	Namespace string `json:"namespace"`

	// Phase of the canary analysis
	Phase CanaryPhase `json:"phase"`

	// Metadata (key-value pairs) for this webhook
	Metadata map[string]string `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
}
```

For more information on Webhooks in Flagger, see the 
[Flagger documentation](https://docs.flagger.app/usage/webhooks)


## Using Flagger's load tester to manually gate a promotion
To enable manual approval of a promotion we are going to configure the 
`confirm-promotion` webhook to call a particular gate provided through 
Flagger's included load tester. This is an easy way to experiment with 
the capability using Flagger's included components. 

**Important note**
We strongly recommend that you DO NOT USE the load tester for manual gating 
in a production environment. There is no auth on the load tester, so 
anyone with access to the cluster would be able to open and close; and 
the load tester has no storage, so if restarted - all gates would close. 

Instead, configure these webhooks for appropriate integration with a 
tool of your choice such Jira, Slack, Jenkins, etc.

### Configure the confirm-promotion webhook
In your Canary object, add the following in the `analysis` section:

```yaml
  analysis:
    webhooks:
      - name: "ask for confirmation"
        type: confirm-promotion
        url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/gate/check
```

This gate is closed by default.

### Deploy a new version of your application
Trigger a Canary rollout by updating your target deployment/daemonset, for 
example by bumping the container image tag. A full list of ways to trigger 
a rollout is available 
[here](https://docs.flagger.app/faq#how-to-retry-a-failed-release).

### Wait for the Canary analysis to complete
TODO: add screenshots and explain with WGE UI

### Open the gate
To open the gate and therefore confirm that you are happy for the new 
version of your application to be promoted, we can exec into the load tester 
container:

```
$ kubectl -n test exec -it flagger-loadtester-xxxx-xxxx sh

# to open
> curl -d '{"name": "app","namespace":"test"}' http://localhost:8080/gate/open
```

Flagger will now proceed to promote the Canary version to the primary and 
complete the progressive delivery rollout :tada:

To manually close the gate again you can issue:

```
> curl -d '{"name": "app","namespace":"test"}' http://localhost:8080/gate/close
```
