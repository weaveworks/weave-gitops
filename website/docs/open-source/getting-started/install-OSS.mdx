# Step 1: Getting Started

:::tip
These instructions only apply to Weave GitOps Open Source. To install Weave GitOps Enterprise, [go here](../../enterprise/getting-started/install-enterprise.mdx).
:::

This page covers Weave GitOps Open Source installation and is adapted from the [Flux - Getting Started](https://fluxcd.io/docs/get-started/) guide.

If you haven't already, please check out our [Introduction to Weave GitOps](../../intro-weave-gitops.mdx) page for additional information about Weave GitOps Open Source as well as our Enterprise version.

## Prerequisites

Before you can install Weave GitOps Open Source, you will need:
- An account with a Git provider like GitHub or GitLab, along with a personal access token with repo permissions; if you're using GitHub, for example, [go here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- Your Git client configured properly (if using GitHub, for example,
then review their docs on [setting your username](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer) and
[your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-email-address-for-every-repository-on-your-computer))
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- A Kubernetes cluster such as [Kind][kind]
- [kubectl][kubectl]
- A public GitHub repo called `fleet-infra`. To create this, follow [GitHub’s instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)—using `fleet-infra` instead of `hello-world`.

We also recommend taking a look at the [Flux Core Concepts page](https://fluxcd.io/flux/concepts/) if you need to brush up on terminology.

### Check your Cluster's Kubernetes Version

No matter which version of Weave GitOps you install, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster up
and running. We test Weave GitOps against the latest [supported Kubernetes releases](https://kubernetes.io/releases/).

Note that the version of [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/#prerequisites) that you use might impose further minimum version requirements.

### Install Flux

Weave GitOps is an extension to Flux. Therefore, it requires that Flux 0.32 or a
later version has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster. Full documentation
is available [here][fl-install].

In this section we are going to do the following:

- Add Flux component manifests to the repository
- Deploy Flux components to your Kubernetes cluster
- Configure the Flux components to track the path `./clusters/my-cluster/` in the repository

Let's get into it... :sparkles:

#### Install the Flux CLI

   ```
   brew install fluxcd/tap/flux
   ```

To upgrade to the latest version, run this command:

```
brew upgrade fluxcd/tap/flux
```

We recommend upgrading the CLI before running bootstrap to upgrade the controllers with `flux bootstrap`.

Find which version is installed with `flux -v`, and use that for `flux bootstrap --version=v<CLI-VERSION>`.

With Bash, you can run `sudo curl -s https://fluxcd.io/install.sh | sudo FLUX_VERSION=<VERSION> bash`.

:::tip
If you want to install an older version of Flux CLI, you can download the binary for your OS from the [releases page](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases).
:::

For other installation methods, see the relevant [Flux documentation][fl-install].

#### Export your credentials

Ensure your PAT has `repo` scope.

   ```
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
   export GITHUB_USER=<your-username>
   ```

#### Check your Kubernetes cluster

   ```
   flux check --pre
   ```

   The output is similar to:
   ```
   ► checking prerequisites
   ✔ kubernetes 1.22.2 >=1.20.6
   ✔ prerequisites checks passed
   ```

#### Install Flux onto your cluster with the `flux bootstrap` command

`flux bootstrap` creates a `flux system` folder in your repository that includes the manifests Flux needs to operate. It also generates a key value pair for Flux to access the repo.

The command below assumes the Git provider is `github`. If you would rather use GitLab, change this to `gitlab`.

   ```
   flux bootstrap github \
     --owner=$GITHUB_USER \
     --repository=fleet-infra \
     --branch=main \
     --path=./clusters/my-cluster \
     --personal \
     --components-extra image-reflector-controller,image-automation-controller
   ```

Full installation documentation, including how to work with other Git providers, is available [here][fl-install].

### Install the `gitops` CLI

Weave GitOps includes a command-line interface to help users create and manage resources. The `gitops` CLI is currently supported on Mac (x86 and Arm) and Linux, including Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Windows support is a [planned enhancement](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/issues/663).

There are multiple ways to install the `gitops` CLI:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs groupId="installation" default>
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/releases/download/v0.38.0/gitops-$(uname)-$(uname -m).tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/gitops /usr/local/bin
gitops version
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="homebrew" label="Homebrew">

```console
brew tap weaveworks/tap
brew install weaveworks/tap/gitops
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Install Weave GitOps

In this section we will:

- use the GitOps CLI tool to generate [`HelmRelease`][helm-rel] and [`HelmRepository`][helm-repo] objects.
- create some login credentials to access the dashboard. This is a simple but **insecure**
  method of protecting and accessing your GitOps dashboard.
- commit the generated yamls to our `fleet-infra` repo.
- observe that they are synced to the cluster.

#### Clone your Git repository where Flux has been bootstrapped

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USER/fleet-infra
   cd fleet-infra
   ```

If you have difficulty saving the YAML to the correct path, run the command `mkdir -p ./clusters/my-cluster`.

#### Deploy

Run the following command, which will create a `HelmRepository` and `HelmRelease` to deploy Weave GitOps:

   ```
   PASSWORD="<A new password you create, removing the brackets and including the quotation marks>"
   gitops create dashboard ww-gitops \
     --password=$PASSWORD \
     --export > ./clusters/my-cluster/weave-gitops-dashboard.yaml
   ```

:::warning
This command stores a hash of a password. This is relatively safe for demo and testing purposes, but we strongly
recommend using a more secure method of storing secrets (such as [Flux's SOPS integration][sops]) for production systems.

Our docs on [securing access to the dashboard](../../enterprise/getting-started/install-enterprise.mdx#configuring-the-emergency-user) provide additional guidance and alternative login methods.
:::

You will use the password you've just created when you've finished Weave GitOps Open Source installation and are ready to login to the dashboard UI.

:::warning
Currently, we do not have a persistent session storage, this means that if you scale to multiple replicas, logins will not be persisted.
:::

:::tip
If you need to customize the Weave GitOps Helm release, you can use the `--values` CLI flag to supply one or more values files.

:::

#### Commit and push the `weave-gitops-dashboard.yaml` to the `fleet-infra` repository

   ```
   git add -A && git commit -m "Add Weave GitOps Dashboard"
   git push
   ```

#### Validate that Weave GitOps and Flux are installed

Note: this wont be instantaneous. Give the Flux controllers a couple of minutes to pull the latest commit.

   ```
   kubectl get pods -n flux-system
   ```

   You should see something similar to:

   ```
   NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   helm-controller-5bfd65cd5f-gj5sz           1/1     Running   0          10m
   kustomize-controller-6f44c8d499-s425n      1/1     Running   0          10m
   notification-controller-844df5f694-2pfcs   1/1     Running   0          10m
   source-controller-6b6c7bc4bb-ng96p         1/1     Running   0          10m
   ww-gitops-weave-gitops-86b645c9c6-k9ftg    1/1     Running   0          5m
   ```

If you wait for a while and still nothing happens, it might be that your manifests haven’t been exported to the repository. This means that Weave GitOps won't install.

:::tip
You can use the Weave GitOps Helm Chart to customize your installation.
Find the full Chart reference [here](../../references/helm-reference.md).

## Supercharge your Weave GitOps

You could optionally unlock more from Weave GitOps by installing other components:

- [Policy Agent:](../../../policy/intro/) for policy enforcement. Use the Flux Manifests [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/main/docs/release.yaml).
- [Tf-Controller:](../../../terraform/terraform-intro/) for infrastructure management. Use the Flux Manifests [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaveworks/policy-agent/dev/docs/examples/policy-agent-helmrelease.yaml)

### View them in the UI

1. Enable the feature flag [WEAVE_GITOPS_FEATURE_GITOPS_RUNTIME](../../references/helm-reference.md).
2. Leverage [Flux Post-Rendering](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/helm/helmreleases/#post-renderers) to label Deployments and CRDs with  `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: weave-gitops`


<details><summary>Expand to see a simplified example for TF-controller</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta2
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: tf-controller
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  # ... omitted for simplicity
  interval: 1h0s
  postRenderers:
  - kustomize:
      patchesStrategicMerge:
      - apiVersion: apps/v1
