# GitOps Run Overview

## Introduction

GitOps is a powerful mechanism for creating consistent environments and keeping
multiple clusters in sync. If you build out your infrastructure correctly,
you get predictable behaviours for your teams and you can have new environments
up and running quickly.

However, GitOps can be challenging for developers
to work with and it can create some friction, especially for developers who are
less familiar with Kubernetes or Flux.

The purpose of GitOps Run is to remove the complexity for developers so that
platform operators can create developer environments easily, and application developers
can benefit from GitOps and focus on writing code.

Watch this video to learn more about how GitOps Run can help your team
get started with GitOps:

### Additional Benefits
* No need to run `kubectl`, `helm`, `kustomize`, or `flux` CLI commands. Just create the manifests and we'll put them on the cluster for you.
* Reduces the cycle time when configuring your cluster.  With normal GitOps
  there is a lot of commit/push/reconcile workflows that can be frustrating.
  This skips that and you can test your changes directly before committing and
  pushing code to your Git repository.
* Multiple options for debugging Flux such as using the Dashboard that comes with Weave GitOps or getting live feedback by leveraging the [GitOps Tools for Flux](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Weaveworks.vscode-gitops-tools) VSCode extension.

## Terminology

### Modes

#### GitOps:
This is the default mode we are always aiming for when using Weave GitOps. Whenever GitOps Run
is not active we want users to be in this mode. This means that the cluster is being driven by
some mechanism reading from Git, ideally Flux, and that system is applying those changes
to the cluster.

#### Run:
This is when the cluster has GitOps Run running on the cluster. There is a live reload session
that is occurring and the cluster is no longer in a pure GitOps or Snowflake mode. Ideally, when
GitOps Run stops running that the cluster enters into the GitOps mode that is defined above.

#### Snowflake:
We are referring to a cluster that is driven by some other mechanism outside of GitOps or Run.
For example, a platform operator could have run various kubectl apply commands and installed
a few helm charts using helm. The only way for this cluster to reach this state again is to
rerun those commands or to transition to GitOps mode.

### Sessions

Weave GitOps Run can has two different ways of interacting with your cluster.

#### Sandboxed

This means we spin up a virtual cluster on your cluster creating a sandbox environment for your applications.
What this means is that you are running this application in an isolated environment and it will not impact the
rest of your cluster.  When you are done and turn off GitOps Run we will then clean up the virtual cluster and
everything that was installed on it.  You can push your changes to Git and then our system will take care of
pulling those changes onto the cluster.

#### Cluster
When you pass the `--no-session` flag when starting up GitOps Run this means we do not put those payloads in
their own sandboxed environment.  We will load them up directly into the cluster just as you would any other app.
