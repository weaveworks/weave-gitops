# Managing secrets with Sops


In this document, we will cover the prerequisites for using [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) with Weave GitOps Enterprise, and how to configure SOPS for your existing Kubernetes cluster to work with GPG and age keys.

For a more advanced setup for SOPS with flux, please refer to this [guide](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/). 


## Encrypting secrets using GPG/OpenPGP

OpenPGP is a way of using Sops to encrypt and decrypt secrets with Weave GitOps Enterprise.

Here are the steps to generate an OpenPGP key and configure your cluster to work with Weave GitOps Enterprise secrets management.

1- Generate a gpg key pairs

```bash
export KEY_NAME="gpg-key"
export KEY_COMMENT="gpg key"

gpg --batch --full-generate-key <<EOF
%no-protection
Key-Type: 1
Key-Length: 4096
Subkey-Type: 1
Subkey-Length: 4096
Expire-Date: 0
Name-Comment: ${KEY_COMMENT}
Name-Real: ${KEY_NAME}
EOF
```

2- Export the key pairs fingerprint in the shell
```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys "${KEY_NAME}"

sec   rsa4096 2020-09-06 [SC]
      710DC0DB6C1662F707095FC30233CB21E656A3CB
      
export KEY_FP="710DC0DB6C1662F707095FC30233CB21E656A3CB"
```

3- Export the generated private key to a kubernetes secret `sops-gpg-private-key` which will be used by flux's kustomize-controller to decrypt the secrets using sops.

```bash
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor "${KEY_FP}" |
kubectl create secret generic sops-gpg-private-key \
--namespace=flux-system \
--from-file=sops.asc=/dev/stdin
```

4- Export the generated public key to a kubernetes secret `sops-gpg-public-key` which will be used by Weave GitOps Enterprise to encrypt the secrets created from the UI.

```bash
gpg --export --armor "${KEY_FP}" |
kubectl create secret generic sops-gpg-public-key \
--namespace=flux-system \
--from-file=sops.asc=/dev/stdin
```

:::tip
 It's recommended to remove the secret from your machine

```bash
gpg --delete-secret-keys "${KEY_FP}"
```
:::

5- Create a kustomization for reconciling the secrets on the cluster and set the `--decryption-secret` flag to the name of the private key created in step 3.

```bash
flux create kustomization gpg-secrets \
--source=secrets \
--path=./secrets/gpg \
--prune=true \
--interval=10m \
--decryption-provider=sops \
--decryption-secret=sops-gpg-private-key
```

6- Annotate the kustomization object created in the previous step with the name and namespace of the public key created in step 4.

```bash
kubectl annotate kustomization gpg-secrets \
sops-public-key/name=sops-gpg-public-key \
sops-public-key/namespace=flux-system
```

The kustomization object should looks like this

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: gpg-secrets
  namespace: flux-system
  annotations:
    sops-public-key/name: sops-gpg-public-key
    sops-public-key/namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 10m
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: secrets
  path: ./secrets/gpg
  decryption:
    provider: sops
    secretRef:
      name: sops-gpg-private-key
  prune: true
  validation: server
```

:::note
This is an essential step in order to allow other operators and developers to utilize WeaveGitOps UI to encrypt SOPS secrets using the public key secret in the cluster.

## Encrypting secrets using age

[age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) is a simple, modern and secure file encryption tool, that can be used to encrypt secrets using Weave GitOps Enterprise.

Here are the steps to generate an age key and configure your cluster to work with Weave GitOps Enterprise secrets management.

1- Generate an age key with age-keygen

```bash
age-keygen -o age.agekey

Public key: <public key>
```

2- Export the generated private key to a kubernetes secret `sops-age-private-key` which will be used by flux's kustomize-controller to decrypt the secrets using sops.

```bash
cat age.agekey | 
kubectl create secret generic sops-age-private-key \
--namespace=flux-system \
--from-file=age.agekey=/dev/stdin
```

4- Export the generated public key to a kubernetes secret `sops-age-public-key` which will be used by Weave GitOps Enterprise to encrypt the secrets created from the UI.

```bash
echo "<public key>" |
kubectl create secret generic sops-age-public-key \
--namespace=flux-system \
--from-file=age.agekey=/dev/stdin
```

:::tip
It's recommended to remove the secret from your machine

```bash
rm -f age.ageKey
```

:::

5- Create a kustomization for reconciling the secrets on the cluster and set the `--decryption-secret` flag to the name of the private key created in step 2

```bash
flux create kustomization age-secrets \
--source=secrets \ # the git source to reconcile the secrets from
--path=./secrets/age \
--prune=true \
--interval=10m \
--decryption-provider=sops \
--decryption-secret=sops-age-private-key
```

6- Annotate the kustomization object created in the previous step with the name and namespace of the public key created in step 4.

```bash
kubectl annotate kustomization secrets \
sops-public-key/name=sops-age-public-key \
sops-public-key/namespace=flux-system
```

The kustomization object should looks like this

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: age-secrets
  namespace: flux-system
  annotations:
    sops-public-key/name: sops-age-public-key
    sops-public-key/namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 10m
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: secrets
  path: ./secrets/age
  decryption:
    provider: sops
    secretRef:
      name: sops-age-private-key
  prune: true
  validation: server
```

:::note
 This is an essential step in order to allow other operators and developers to utilize WeaveGitOps UI to encrypt SOPS secrets using the public key secret in the cluster.
:::

:::tip
 In case of using OpenPGP and age in the same cluster, you need to make the kustomizations point to different directories. This is because flux's kustomize-controller expects that all the secrets in the kustomization's path are encrypted with the same key.
:::

## Security Recommendations

Access to sops decryption secrets should be restricted and allowed only to be read by flux's kustomize controller. This can be done using Kubernetes RBAC.

Here's an example of how you can use RBAC to restrict access to sops decryption secrets:

1. Create a new Kubernetes role that grants read access to sops decryption secrets

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: sops-secrets-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  resourceNames: ["sops-gpg-private-key", "sops-age-private-key"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

2. Bind the role to the service account of the flux's kustomize-controller

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: sops-secrets-rolebinding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: sops-secrets-role
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: kustomize-controller
```

:::caution
You would need to ensure that no other rolebindings or clusterrolebndings would allow reading the the decryption secret at any time. This could be achieved by leveraging policy capabilities to detect existing and prevent future creation of roles that would grant read secrets permissions.
