## Secrets Management

Secrets are sensitive information such as passwords, access keys, and other credentials that should not be exposed publicly. In cloud-native applications, secrets are often used to authenticate and authorize access to various resources, such as databases, APIs, and other services.

In a GitOps environment, secrets are typically stored either encrypted in Git, or using Custom Resources that reference the secret in an external secret store. Secrets are then get synced into the clusters and securely passed to the application containers or workloads. 

Effective secrets management in cloud-native applications and GitOps environments is critical for maintaining the security and compliance of the overall system. Best practices include regularly rotating secrets, using strong encryption and access controls, and implementing robust auditing and monitoring processes.
