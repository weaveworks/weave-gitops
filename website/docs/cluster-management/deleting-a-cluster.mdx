### How to: delete a cluster using UI

### How to: delete a cluster using CLI

To delete a cluster or clusters using cli run:

```
gitops delete cluster <cluster-name>
```

Merge the PR to delete the clusters.

### Notes

A current limitation is the inability to apply an _empty_ repository to a cluster. If you have capi clusters and other manifests commited to this repository, and then _delete all of them_ so there are 0 manifests left, then the apply will fail and the resources will not be removed from the cluster.
A workaround is to add a dummy _ConfigMap_ back to the git repository after deleting everything else so that there is at least 1 manifest to apply.
