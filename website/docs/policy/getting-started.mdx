# Getting Started <TierLabel tiers="Enterprise" />
Enabling the Weave Policy Engine features in Weave GitOps is done by running the policy agent on the cluster. This section gives an overview of the steps required for installing and running the policy agent on the management and leaf clusters.

## Pre-requisites

### Weave GitOps
You need to have a running instance of Weave GitOps with at least one CAPI provider installed to provision Kubernetes clusters. See [Weave GitOps Installation](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/installation/) page for more details about installing Weave GitOps.

### Policy Library
For the policy agent to work, it will need a source for the policies that it will enforce in the cluster. You should have a policy library repo set up which includes your policies resources as CRDs. You can also add a `kustomization.yaml` file selecting the policies you want to install on that specific cluster that will be provisioned by Weave Gitops:

```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- policies/<policy1.yaml>
- policies/<policy2.yaml>
- policies/<policy3.yaml>
```

:::info
Enterprise customers should have access to fork policy library repo into their local repositories.

## Install the policy agent

### Management cluster

The agent comes packaged with the WGE chart. To install it you need to set the following values:

- `values.policy-agent.enabled`: set to true to install the agent with WGE
- `values.policy-agent.accountId`: organization name, used as identifier
- `values.policy-agent.clusterId`: unique identifier for the cluster

### Leaf cluster

To install the policy agent on a leaf cluster, you should select the `weave-policy-agent` from the profiles dropdown in the `Create Cluster` page.

You should then configure the `values.yaml`. You can find more about the policy profile configurations [here](../weave-policy-profile/).

## Policies in UI
After the leaf cluster is provisioned and the profile is installed, you should now see the policies listed in the Policies tab in Weave GitOps UI.

![Policies](./img/weave-policies.png)

Now you have a provisioned cluster with these policies enforced by the policy agent.

> By default, the policy profile is set up to enforce policies at deployment time using admission controller, which results in blocking any deployment that violates the enforced policies.

## Prevent Violating Changes
Now let's try to deploy a Kubernetes deployment that violates one of the enforced policies. Let's deploy a deployment that has `spec.securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` as `true`. This violates the `Allow Privilege Escalation` policy.

Once you apply it, the policy agent will deny this request and show a violation message.

## Violations Logs in UI
You can view all the violation log in Weave GitOps UI to view all connected clusters policy violations, and where you can dive into the details of each violation.
