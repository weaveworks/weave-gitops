## Guide

Currently rendering templates operates in two phases:

 * Generate all template parameters from the configured generators
 * Render all the templates for each set of template parameters

Please read the [security information](#security) below before using this.

## Generation

The simplest generator is the `List` generator.

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: gitopsset-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - list:
        elements:
          - env: dev
            team: dev-team
          - env: production
            team: ops-team
          - env: staging
            team: ops-team
```

The elements in there are a set JSON of objects[^yaml], there are three in this example, and each of them has two keys, `env` and `team`.

Other generators provide different sets of keys and values.

The [generators](#generators) documentation below provides more information on what the other generators output.

## Rendering templates

Templates are Kubernetes resources in YAML format.

Each template is rendered for each element generated by the generators

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: gitopsset-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - list:
        elements:
          - env: dev
            team: dev-team
          - env: production
            team: ops-team
          - env: staging
            team: ops-team
  templates:
    - content:
        kind: Kustomization
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        metadata:
          name: "{{ .element.env }}-demo"
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: go-demo
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: "{{ .element.env }}"
            com.example/team: "{{ .element.team }}"
        spec:
          interval: 5m
          path: "./examples/kustomize/environments/{{ .element.env }}"
          prune: true
          sourceRef:
            kind: GitRepository
            name: go-demo-repo
```

The generated elements are provided to the template in the `element` scope, so
`.element.dev` refers to the `dev` field from the List element.

The output from all generators is exposed in the `element` scope, not just List
generators.

## Repeating templates

The output from a generator is an array of JSON objects[^yaml], the keys of which can contain repeating elements, either further JSON objects, or scalar values.

It can be desirable to repeat a template for a repeated element in a generated
value.

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: repeated-gitopsset-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - list:
        elements:
          - env: dev
            team: dev-team
            teams:
              - name: "team1"
              - name: "team2"
              - name: "team3"
          - env: staging
            team: staging-team
            teams:
              - name: "team4"
              - name: "team5"
              - name: "team6"
  templates:
    - repeat: "{ .teams }"
      content:
        kind: ConfigMap
        apiVersion: v1
        metadata:
          name: "{{ .repeat.name }}-demo"
        data:
          name: "{{ .repeat.name }}-demo"
          team: "{{ .element.team }}"
```

The template `repeat` field is a [JSONPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) expression that is applied to each element during the template rendering.

Templates that use `repeat` will have two separate scopes for the template params, `.element` which is the top-level element generated by the generator, an additional `.repeat` scope is provided, which is the repeating element.

In this case, six different `ConfigMaps` are generated, three for the "dev-team" and three for the "staging-team".
