# Using GitOpsSets <TierLabel tiers="enterprise" />

:::caution

**This feature is in alpha and certain aspects will change**

We're very excited for people to use this feature.
However, please note that some changes will be made to the API and behavior,
particularly to enhance security by implementing impersonation for more
fine-grained control over how the generated resources are applied.

:::

## Basics

Currently rendering templates operates in two phases:

 * Generate all template parameters from the configured generators
 * Render all the templates for each set of template parameters

Please read the [security information](#security) below before using this.

## Generation

The simplest generator is the `List` generator.

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: gitopsset-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - list:
        elements:
          - env: dev
            team: dev-team
          - env: production
            team: ops-team
          - env: staging
            team: ops-team
```

The elements in there are a set JSON of objects[^yaml], there are three in this example, and each of them has two keys, `env` and `team`.

Other generators provide different sets of keys and values.

The [generators](#generators) documentation below provides more information on what the other generators output.

## Rendering templates

Templates are Kubernetes resources in YAML format.

Each template is rendered for each element generated by the generators

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: gitopsset-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - list:
        elements:
          - env: dev
            team: dev-team
          - env: production
            team: ops-team
          - env: staging
            team: ops-team
  templates:
    - content:
        kind: Kustomization
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        metadata:
          name: "{{ .element.env }}-demo"
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: go-demo
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: "{{ .element.env }}"
            com.example/team: "{{ .team }}"
        spec:
          interval: 5m
          path: "./examples/kustomize/environments/{{ .element.env }}"
          prune: true
          sourceRef:
            kind: GitRepository
            name: go-demo-repo
```

The generated elements are provided to the template in the `element` scope, so
`.element.dev` refers to the `dev` field from the List element.

The output from all generators is exposed in the `element` scope, not just List
generators.

## Repeating templates

The output from a generator is an array of JSON objects[^yaml], the keys of which can contain repeating elements, either further JSON objects, or scalar values.

It can be desirable to repeat a template for a repeated element in a generated
value.

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: repeated-gitopsset-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - list:
        elements:
          - env: dev
            team: dev-team
            teams:
              - name: "team1"
              - name: "team2"
              - name: "team3"
          - env: staging
            team: staging-team
            teams:
              - name: "team4"
              - name: "team5"
              - name: "team6"
  templates:
    - repeat: "{ .teams }"
      content:
        kind: ConfigMap
        apiVersion: v1
        metadata:
          name: "{{ .repeat.name }}-demo"
        data:
          name: "{{ .repeat.name }}-demo"
          team: "{{ .element.team }}"
```

The template `repeat` field is a [JSONPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) expression that is applied to each element during the template rendering.

Templates that use `repeat` will have two separate scopes for the template params, `.element` which is the top-level element generated by the generator, an additional `.repeat` scope is provided, which is the repeating element.

In this case, six different `ConfigMaps` are generated, three for the "dev-team" and three for the "staging-team".

## Generators

We currently provide these generators:

 * list
 * pullRequests
 * gitRepository
 * matrix

## List generator

This is the simplest generator, this is a hard-coded array of JSON objects, described as YAML mappings.

### GitRepository generator

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: repository-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - gitRepository:
        repositoryRef: go-demo-repo
        files:
          - path: examples/generation/dev.yaml
          - path: examples/generation/production.yaml
          - path: examples/generation/staging.yaml
  templates:
    - content:
        kind: Kustomization
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        metadata:
          name: "{{ .element.env }}-demo"
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: go-demo
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: "{{ .element.env }}"
            com.example/team: "{{ .element.team }}"
        spec:
          interval: 5m
          path: "./examples/kustomize/environments/{{ .element.env }}"
          prune: true
          sourceRef:
            kind: GitRepository
            name: go-demo-repo
```

In this example, a [Flux `GitRepository`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/) called `go-demo-repo` in the same namespace as the `GitOpsSet` will be tracked, and `Kustomization` resources are generated from the three files listed.

These files can be JSON or YAML.

Changes pushed to the `GitRepository` will result in rereconciliation of the templates into the cluster.

For security reasons, you need to explicitly list out the files that the generator should parse.

### PullRequests generator

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: pull-requests-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - pullRequests:
        interval: 5m
        driver: github
        repo: bigkevmcd/go-demo
        secretRef:
          name: github-secret
  templates:
    - content:
        apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        kind: GitRepository
        metadata:
          name: "pr-{{ .element.number }}-gitrepository"
          namespace: default
        spec:
          interval: 5m0s
          url: "{{ .element.clone_url }}"
          ref:
            branch: "{{ .element.branch }}"
    - content:
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        kind: Kustomization
        metadata:
          name: "pr-{{ .element.number }}-demo"
          namespace: default
        spec:
          interval: 5m
          path: "./examples/kustomize/environments/dev"
          prune: true
          targetNamespace: "{{ .element.branch }}-ns"
          sourceRef:
            kind: GitRepository
            name: "pr-{{ .element.number }}-gitrepository"
```
This example will poll "github.com/bigkevmcd/go-demo" for open pull requests and trigger the deployment of these by creating a Flux `GitRepository` and `Kustomization` to deploy.

As the generator only queries open pull requests, when a PR is closed, the generated resources will be removed.

For non-public installations, you can configure the `serverURL` field and point it to your own installation.

The `driver` field can be `github` or `gitlab` or `bitbucketserver`, other options can be supported from [go-scm](https://github.com/jenkins-x/go-scm/blob/main/scm/factory/factory.go).

Additionally labels can be provided for querying pull requests with matching labels e.g.
```yaml
- pullRequests:
    interval: 5m
    driver: github
    repo: bigkevmcd/go-demo
    secretRef:
      name: github-secret
    labels:
      - deploy
```

The fields emitted by the pull-request are as follows:

 * `number` this is generated as a string representation
 * `branch` this is the source branch
 * `head_sha` this is the SHA of the commit in the merge branch
 * `clone_url` this is the HTTPS clone URL for this repository
 * `clone_ssh_url` this is the SSH clone URL for this repository

You will need an API key that can query the GitHub API.
```shell
$ kubectl create secret generic github-secret \
  --from-literal password=<insert access token here>
```
You can limit the scope of this token to read only access to your repositories.

### Matrix generator

The matrix generator doesn't generate by itself, it combines the results of
generating from other generators e.g.:

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: matrix-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - matrix:
        generators:
          - gitRepository:
              repositoryRef: go-demo-repo
              files:
                - path: examples/generation/dev.yaml
                - path: examples/generation/production.yaml
                - path: examples/generation/staging.yaml
          - list:
              elements:
                - cluster: dev-cluster
                  version: 1.0.0
```

This will result in three sets of generated parameters, which are a combination of the maps in the files in the gitRepository, and the elements in the list generator, this can result in a combinatorial explosion of resources being created in your cluster.

```yaml
- env: dev
  team: developers
  cluster: dev-cluster
  version: 1.0.0
- env: staging
  team: staging-team
  cluster: dev-cluster
  version: 1.0.0
- env: production
  team: production-team
  cluster: dev-cluster
  version: 1.0.0
```

These can be referenced in the templates, note that all keys in the merged generators from the Matrix are contained in the `element` scope.

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: GitOpsSet
metadata:
  name: matrix-sample
spec:
  generators:
    - matrix:
        generators:
          - gitRepository:
              repositoryRef: go-demo-repo
              files:
                - path: examples/generation/dev.yaml
                - path: examples/generation/production.yaml
                - path: examples/generation/staging.yaml
          - list:
              elements:
                - cluster: dev-cluster
                  version: 1.0.0
  templates:
    - content:
        kind: Kustomization
        apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        metadata:
          name: "{{ .element.env }}-demo"
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: go-demo
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: "{{ .element.env }}"
            com.example/team: "{{ .element.team }}"
            com.example/cluster: "{{ .element.cluster }}"
            com.example/version: "{{ .element.version }}"
        spec:
          interval: 5m
          path: "./examples/kustomize/environments/{{ .element.env }}"
          prune: true
          sourceRef:
            kind: GitRepository
            name: go-demo-repo
```

## Security

**WARNING** generating resources and applying them directly into your cluster can be dangerous to the health of your cluster.

This is especially true for the `GitRepository` generator, where it may not be obvious to the author of the files, or the author of the template the consequences of the template rendering.

The default `ServiceAccount` that is used by the gitopssets-controller is extremely limited, and can not create resources, you will need to explicitly grant permissions to create any of the resources you declare in the template, missing permissions will appear in the controller logs.

It is not recommended that you create a role with blanket permissions, under the right circumstances, someone could accidentally _or_ maliciously overwrite the cluster control-plane, which could be very dangerous.
