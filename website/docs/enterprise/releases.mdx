## v0.11.0
2022-11-25

### Highlights

#### GitOpsTemplates
- We are working towards unifying CAPI and GitOps Templates under a single umbrella. For those already using CAPITemplates, we will ensure a smooth transition is possible by making use of a conversion hooks. There are some breaking changes for GitOpsTemplates as part of this transitionary period, so be sure to check the guidance under [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes).
- We now retain the ordering of parameters in the template instead of sorting them alphabetically. Providing to the author control in what sequence the parameters are rendered in the form and thus present a more logically grouped set of parameters to the end consumer.
- You can control what [delimiters](../gitops-templates/templates/#custom-delimiters-for-rendertype-templating) you want to use in a template. This provides flexibility for if you want to use the syntax for dynamic functions like the [helper functions](../gitops-templates/templates/#supported-functions-from-sprig-library) we support.

#### Pipelines
- This [feature](pipelines/intro.mdx) is now enabled by default when you install the Weave GitOps Enterprise Helm Chart. You can toggle this with the `enablePipelines` flag. 
- GitOpsTemplates are a highly flexible way to create new resources - including Pipelines. We now provide a shortcut on the Pipelines table view to navigate you to Templates with the `weave.works/template-type=pipeline` label.

### Dependency versions
- weave-gitops v0.11.0
- cluster-controller v1.4.1
- cluster-bootstrap-controller v0.3.0
- (optional) pipeline-controller v0.0.11
- (optional) policy-agent 2.1.1

### Breaking changes

#### GitOpsTemplates and CAPITemplates
We are making these changes to provide a unified and inutitive self-service experience within Weave GitOps Enterprise, removing misleading and potentially confusing terminology born from when only Clusters were backed by Templates.

**New API Group for the GitOpsTemplate CRD**
- old: `clustertemplates.weave.works`
- new: `templates.weave.works`

After upgrading Weave GitOps Enterprise which includes the updated CRD:
1. Update all your GitOpsTemplates in Git changing all occurances of `apiVersion: clustertemplates.weave.works/v1alpha1` to `apiVersion: templates.weave.works/v1alpha1`.
2. Commit, push and reconcile. They should now be viewable in the Templates view again.
3. Clean up the old CRD. As it stands:
   - `kubectl get gitopstemplate -A` will be empty as it is pointing to the old `clustertemplates.weave.works` CRD.
   - `kubectl get gitopstemplate.templates.weave.works -A` will work
To fix the former of the commands, remove the old CRD (helm does not do this automatically for safety reasons):
   - `kubectl delete crd gitopstemplates.clustertemplates.weave.works`
   - You may have to wait up to 5 minutes for your local kubectl CRD cache to invalidate, then `kubectl get gitopstemplate -A` should be working as usual

**Template Profiles / Applications / Credentials sections are hidden by default**

For both `CAPITemplates` and `GitopsTemplates` the default visibility for all sections in a template has been set to `"false"`. To re-enable profiles or applications on a template you can tweak the annotations

```yaml
annotations:
  templates.weave.works/profiles-enabled: "true" # enable profiles
  templates.weave.works/kustomizations-enabled: "true" # enable applications
  templates.weave.works/credentials-enabled: "true" # enable CAPI credentials
```

**The default values for a profile are not fetched and included in a pull-request**

Prior to this release WGE would fetch the default values.yaml for every profile installed and include them in the `HelmReleases` in the Pull Request when rendering out the profiles of a template.

This was an expensive operation and occasionally led to timeouts.

The new behaviour is to omit the values and fall back to the defaults included in the helm-chart. This sacrifices some UX (being able to see all the defaults in the PR and tweak them) to improve performance. **There should not be any final behaviour changes to the installed charts**.

You can still view and tweak the `values.yaml` when selecting profiles to include on the "Create resource (cluster)" page. If changes are made here the updated values.yaml will be included.

2022-10-17

### Highlights
- When adding applications, you can now preview the changes(PR) before creating a pull request
- You can now see included Cluster Profiles when previewing your Create Cluster PR

## v0.9.5
2022-09-22

### Highlights
- **Tenancy**
  - `gitops create tenant` now supports `--prune` to remove old resources from the cluster if you're not using `--export` with gitops.
  - `deploymentRBAC` section in `tenancy.yaml` allows you to specify the permissions given to the flux `Kustomizations` that will apply the resources from git to your tenants' namespaces in the cluster.
  - Support for `OCIRepository` sources when restricting/allowing the sources that can be applied into tenants' namespaces.
- **Templates**
  - Templates now support helm functions for simple transformations of values: `{{ .params.CLUSTER_NAME | upper }}`
  - Templates has moved to its own page in the UI, this is the first step in moving towards embracing them as a more generic feature, not just for cluster creation.
  - If a version is not specified in a **template profile annotation** it can be selected by the user.
  - A `namespace` can be specified in the **template profile annotation** that will be provided as the `HelmRelease`'s `targetNamespace` by default.
- **Bootstrapping**
  - A ClusterBootstrapConfig can now optionally be triggered when `phase="Provisioned"`, rather than `ControlPlaneReady=True` status.

### Dependency versions

### ⚠️ Breaking changes from v0.9.4

If using the policy-agent included in the weave-gitops-enterprise helm chart, the configuration should now be placed under the `config` key.

**old**
```yaml
policy-agent:
  enabled: true
  accountId: "my-account"
  clusterId: "my-cluster"
```

**new**
```yaml
policy-agent:
  enabled: true
  config:
    accountId: "my-account"
    clusterId: "my-cluster"
```
