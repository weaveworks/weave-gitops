## How to: Upgrade to Weave GitOps Enterprise

:::note BEFORE YOU START

Make sure the following software is installed before continuing with these instructions:

- `gitops` >= 0.5.0-rc2. Use `gitops version` to check the currently installed version. If needed, download a newer version of Weave GitOps from the [releases page](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/releases).

Also `GITHUB_TOKEN` should be set as an environment variable in the current shell. It should have permissions to create Pull Requests against the cluster config repo.
:::

Upgrading requires we:

1. Have a cluster with Weave GitOps installed
2. Install a CAPI provider
3. Apply the entitlements secret
4. Upgrade
5. Check that Weave GitOps Enterprise has been installed
6. Connect the management cluster up to itself

### 1. Install `gitops` on a new cluster

We'll use `kind` here as an example.

- The `extraMounts` are for the Docker CAPI provider (CAPD)
- `extraPortMappings` are for easily accessing NATS and the UI

```yaml title="kind-config.yaml"
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    extraMounts:
      - hostPath: /var/run/docker.sock
        containerPath: /var/run/docker.sock
    extraPortMappings:
      - containerPort: 30080
        hostPort: 30080
        listenAddress: "0.0.0.0" # Optional, defaults to "0.0.0.0"
        protocol: tcp # Optional, defaults to tcp
      - containerPort: 31490
        hostPort: 31490
        listenAddress: "0.0.0.0" # Optional, defaults to "0.0.0.0"
        protocol: tcp # Optional, defaults to tcp
```

Fire up cluster

```bash
kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml
```

Create a new repo

```bash
gh repo create my-management-cluster --private --confirm
cd my-management-cluster
echo "# my-management-cluster" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit --all --message "init commit"
git push -u origin main
```

Install Weave Gitops

```bash
gitops install --config-repo https://github.com/my-org/my-repo
```

### 2. Install a CAPI provider

:::note `clusterctl` versions

The example templates provided in this guide have been tested with `clusterctl` version `1.0.1`. However you might need to use an older or newer version depending on the capi-providers you plan on using.

Download a specific version of clusterctl from the [releases page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/releases).
:::

In order to be able to provision Kubernetes clusters, a CAPI provider needs to be installed.

```
# Enable support for `ClusterResourceSet`s for automatically installing CNIs
export EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET=true

clusterctl init --infrastructure docker
```

### 3. Apply the entitlements secret

Contact sales@weave.works for a valid entitlements secret. Then apply it to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f entitlements.yaml
```

### 4. Upgrade

Run the upgrade command specifying the same `--config-repo` used in install and the desired version of Weave GitOps Enterprise.

:::caution `https://` url is important

The `--app-config-url` value supplied to the `upgrade` command must be in `https://` format (not `git@github.com:`)

:::

```bash
gitops upgrade --config-repo https://github.com/my-org/my-repo --version 0.0.16
```
:::note
You may need to add the `--base` flag to the above command to indicate your local branch name, if it is not set to `main`.
:::


A **Pull Request** will be created against your cluster repository. **Review and merge** this pull request to upgrade to Weave GitOps Enterprise.

### 5. Checking that WGE is installed

You should now be able to load the WGE UI:

```bash
kubectl port-forward --namespace wego-system deployments.apps/weave-gitops-enterprise-nginx-ingress-controller 8000:80
```

The WGE UI should now be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### 6. Connect the management cluster up to itself

_Connecting a cluster_ installs the agent which is responsible for detecting new clusters and reporting their status to the UI. We need to install the agent on our newly created management cluster. Check out [How to: Connect a cluster](../cluster-management/managing-existing-clusters.mdx#how-to-connect-a-cluster). The agent should be loaded onto our new management cluster, give it a name like **Management** and leave the Ingress URL blank.

Head over to [Getting started](../cluster-management/getting-started.mdx) to create your first CAPI Cluster.
