# Step 2 - Complete and Onboard

:::info What to expect
You have [started with WGE](../install-enterprise-getting-started) and already familiar with its [bootstrapping workflow](../install-enterprise-getting-started/#bootstrapping).
You now want to complete your baseline setup before onboarding the rest of the team.

This guide provides you with recommendations to meet this bar. At the end of it, you are ready to onboard the rest of the team.
:::

## Authentication

As a reminder, Weave GitOps Enterprise supports as authentication methods, `Cluster User`, that you have likely setup as part of the previous step, and `OIDC`.
OIDC is the recommended way for production, so take the time to set it up before onboarding other users.

### OIDC

:::warning
Currently, we do not have a persistent session storage, this means that if you scale to multiple replicas, logins will not be persisted.
:::

To login via your OIDC provider two steps are required:

1. **Create a Kubernetes secret `oidc-auth` with the OIDC configuration**. This configuration consists of the following parameters:

:::tip
For specific OIDC providers configuration (like Google or Azure) see [this guide](../../../guides/oidc/).
:::

| Parameter         |  Description                                                                                                                      | Default   |
| ------------------|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `issuerURL`       |  The URL of the issuer; typically, the discovery URL without a path                                                                |           |
| `clientID`        |  The client ID set up for Weave GitOps in the issuer                                                                 |           |
| `clientSecret`    |  The client secret set up for Weave GitOps in the issuer                                                             |           |
| `redirectURL`     |  The redirect URL set up for Weave GitOps in the issuer—typically the dashboard URL, followed by `/oauth2/callback ` |           |
| `tokenDuration`   |  The time duration that the ID Token will remain valid after successful authentication                                           | "1h0m0s"  |
| `tokenDuration`   |  The time duration that the ID Token will remain valid after successful authentication                                           | "1h0m0s"  |
| `oidcUsernamePrefix` | The prefix added to users when impersonating API calls to the Kubernetes API, equivalent to --oidc-username-prefix | |
| `oidcGroupsPrefix` | The prefix added to groups when impersonating API calls to the Kubernetes API, equivalent to --oidc-groups-prefix | |

Ensure that your OIDC provider has been set up with a client ID/secret and the dashboard's redirect URL.

2. **Configure WGE to use OIDC**

<Tabs groupId="authentication" default>
<TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI">

Execute `gitops bootstrap auth` to complete the task:

```bash
# Add OIDC configuration to your environment
gitops bootstrap auth --type=oidc --client-id="client-id" \
    --client-secret="client-secret" \
    --discovery-url="discovery-url"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Manual" label="Manual">

1. Create a Kubernetes secret `oidc-auth` with the OIDC configuration

```bash
kubectl create secret generic oidc-auth \
  --namespace flux-system \
  --from-literal=issuerURL="oidc-issuer-url" \
  --from-literal=clientID="client-id" \
  --from-literal=clientSecret="client-secret" \
  --from-literal=redirectURL="redirect-url" \
  --from-literal=tokenDuration="token-duration"
```

2. Configure WGE to use OIDC

```yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: weave-gitops-enterprise
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  # ... other spec components
  values:
    config:
      oidc:
        clientCredentialsSecret: oidc-auth
        enabled: true
        issuerURL: "oidc-issuer-url"
        redirectURL: "redirect-url"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the HTTP server starts, unauthenticated users will have to click 'Login With OIDC Provider' to log in.

## Authorization

Weave GitOps Enterprise works with standard [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) to authorise:

- **Weave GitOps Users:** previously authenticated via either OIDC or Cluster User.
- **Weave GitOps Service Account:** which talks to Kubernetes for user operations via [Impersonation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation).
- **Flux Service Accounts:** which talks to Kubernetes for deployments operations.

During [getting started](../install-enterprise-getting-started/) you have created the default RBAC for the `Cluser User`, `Weave GitOps Service Account`
and `Flux Service Accounts` but not for OIDC users.

### OIDC

Setup Authorization for OIDC users by both defining and deploying the RBAC rules.

#### Defining RBAC Rules

RBAC rules are highly context-dependent and there is no one-size fits all. You would need to take the time with your Security organisation on defining them.
We provide you with the following RBAC Configuration as inspirational to get you conversations started: It is purposefully vague as we intend to give a
broad idea of how to implement such a system.

<details>
<summary>Expand to see a Example RBAC Configuration</summary>

**Recommendation**

Our general recommendation is to use OIDC and a small number of groups that Weave GitOps can impersonate. Configuring Weave GitOps to impersonate Kubernetes groups rather than users has the following benefits:
* A user's permissions for impersonation by Weave GitOps can be separate from
any other permissions that they may or may not have within the cluster.
* Users do not have to be individually managed within the cluster and can have
their permissions managed together.

**Design**

Assume that your company has the following people in OIDC:
* Aisha, a cluster admin, who should have full admin access to Weave GitOps
* Brian, lead of Team-A, who should have admin permissions to their team's
namespace in Weave GitOps and read-only otherwise
* June and Jo, developers in Team-A who should have read-only access to Weave GitOps

You can then create three groups:

* `wego-admin`
    - Bound to the `ClusterRole`, created by Helm, `wego-admin-cluster-role`
    - Aisha is the only member
* `wego-team-a-admin`
    - Bound to a `Role`, using the same permissions as `wego-admin-role`, created
    in Team-A's namespace
    - Brian and Aisha are members
* `wego-readonly`
    - Bound to a `ClusterRole` that matches `wego-admin-cluster-role` but with
    no `patch` permissions.
    - Aisha, Brian, June and Jo are all members

**Code**

```yaml
# Admin cluster role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1

:::caution Using OIDC for cluster and Weave GitOps Authentication
If the same OIDC provider is used to authenticate a user with the cluster
itself (e.g. for use with `kubectl`) and to Weave GitOps then, depending
on OIDC configuration, they may end up with the super-set of their permissions
from Weave GitOps and any other permissions granted to them.

This can lead to unintended consequences, like viewing `secrets`. To avoid
this, OIDC providers will often let you configure which groups are returned
to which clients. The Weave GitOps groups should not be returned to the
cluster client (and vice versa).
:::

</details>

#### Deploy them via `/bases`

Once you have the rules defined, you want to ensure they are available in your environment. The `bases` pattern is a useful approach
to easily achieve this. It works as follows:

<Tabs groupId="bases" defaultValue="manual">
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

:::caution

Not yet supported but planned as part of https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops-enterprise/issues/3618

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" label="Manual">

1. Create a folder in your Git repo in path like `clusters/bases`.
2. Add your RBAC resources into the folder `clusters/bases/rbac`.
3. Create a folder `clusters/management` adding the following `Kustomization`:

```yaml title="clusters/management/clusters-bases-kustomization.yaml"
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: clusters-bases-kustomization
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 10m0s
  path: clusters/bases
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system
```

Save these two files in your Git repository, then commit and push. Flux will deploy the kustomization and the RBAC
resources will be created.

</Tabs>

## Configure Weave GitOps Enterprise

### Enable Write Access to Git

Weave GitOps Enterprise creates pull requests for adding resources. To do this, it needs to be able to write to the Git repository.
Here we provide guidance for GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket Server, and Azure DevOps.

<Tabs groupId="git-provider" default>
<TabItem value="github" label="GitHub">
GitHub requires no additional configuration for OAuth git access
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab">

Create a GitLab OAuth application that will request `api` permissions to create pull requests on your behalf.

Follow the [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html).

The application should have at least these scopes:

- `api`
- `openid`
- `email`
- `profile`

Add callback URLs to the application for each address the UI will be exposed on, e.g.:

- `https://localhost:8000/oauth/gitlab` for port-forwarding and testing
- `https://git.example.com/oauth/gitlab` for production use

Save your application, taking note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save
them into the `git-provider-credentials` secret, along with:

- `GIT_HOST_TYPES` to tell WGE that the host is gitlab
- `GITLAB_HOSTNAME` where the OAuth app is hosted

**Replace values** in this snippet and run:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system \
  --from-literal="GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=13457" \
  --from-literal="GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=24680" \
  --from-literal="GITLAB_HOSTNAME=git.example.com" \
  --from-literal="GIT_HOST_TYPES=git.example.com=gitlab"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bitbucket-server" label="BitBucket Server">

Create a new [incoming application link](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/configure-an-incoming-link-1108483657.html) from
the BitBucket administration dashboard. You will be asked to enter a unique name and the redirect URL for the external application. The redirect URL
should be set to `$WGE_DASHBOARD_URL/oauth/bitbucketserver`. You will also need to select permissions for the application. The minimum set of
permissions needed for WGE to create pull requests on behalf of users is `Repositories - Write`. An example of configuring these settings is shown below.

<figure>

<img src={oauthBitbucket} width="500"/>

<figcaption>Configuring a new incoming application link</figcaption>
</figure>


Save your application and take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save
them into the `git-provider-credentials` secret, along with:

- `GIT_HOST_TYPES` to tell WGE that the host is bitbucket-server
- `BITBUCKET_SERVER_HOSTNAME` where the OAuth app is hosted

**Replace values** in this snippet and run:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system \
  --from-literal="BITBUCKET_SERVER_CLIENT_ID=13457" \
  --from-literal="BITBUCKET_SERVER_CLIENT_SECRET=24680" \
  --from-literal="BITBUCKET_SERVER_HOSTNAME=git.example.com" \
  --from-literal="GIT_HOST_TYPES=git.example.com=bitbucket-server"
```

If the secret is already present, use the following command to update it using your default editor:

```bash
kubectl edit secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system
```

:::info

If BitBucket Server is running on the default port (7990), make sure you include the port number in the values of the secret. For example: `GIT_HOST_TYPES=git.example.com:7990=bitbucket-server`

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="azure-devops" label="Azure DevOps">

Navigate to [VisualStudio](https://app.vsaex.visualstudio.com/app/register) and register a new application, as explained in the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth?view=azure-devops#1-register-your-app). Set the authorization callback URL and select which scopes to grant. Set the callback URL to `$WGE_DASHBOARD_URL/oauth/azuredevops`.

Select the `Code (read and write)` scope from the list. This is necessary so that WGE can create pull requests on behalf of users. An example of configuring these settings is shown below.

<figure>
<img src={oauthAzureDevOps}/>
<figcaption>Creating a new application</figcaption>
</figure>

After creating your application, you will be presented with the application settings. Take note of the `App ID` and `Client Secret` values—you will use them to configure WGE.

<figure>
<img src={oauthAzureDevOpsSuccess}/>
<figcaption>Application settings</figcaption>
</figure>

In your cluster, create a secret named `git-provider-credentials` that contains the `App ID` and `Client Secret` values from the newly created application.

**Replace values** in this snippet and run:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system \
  --from-literal="AZURE_DEVOPS_CLIENT_ID='App ID value'" \
  --from-literal="AZURE_DEVOPS_CLIENT_SECRET='Client Secret value'"
```

WGE is now configured to ask users for authorization the next time a pull request must be created as part of using a template.
Note that each user can view and manage which applications they have authorized by navigating to https://app.vsaex.visualstudio.com/me.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Access the dashboard

During [getting started](../install-enterprise-getting-started/) you have accessed the dashboard via its non-TLS ClusterIP service
which is not recommended to use for production environments. Use this section to evolve your access before onboarding users.

### Configure Service and Ingress

Weave GitOps Enterprise dashboard is by default available via its ClusterIP service. You could To achieve other networking configurations
by modifying the `service` or `ingress` in the `HelmRelease` values:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: weave-gitops-enterprise
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  values:
    service: # update to meet your needs
      ...
    ingress: # update to meet your needs
      ...
```

### Configure TLS

By default, the WGE UI pod will listen on port `8000` with TLS enabled.
WGE will generate and use a self-signed certificate for this purpose.

It can then be accessed via port-forwarding:

`kubectl port-forward --namespace flux-system svc/clusters-service 8000:8000`

If you're using an ingress controller to terminate TLS you can disable it in the Helm release:

```yaml
  values:
    tls:
      enabled: false
```

Other ingress conguration changes can be made via the ingress configuration

```yaml
  values:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      ... other parameters specific to the ingress type ...
```


## Next Steps

Onboard the rest of the Platform Engineering team and head to [Step 3 - Expand](../install-enterprise-getting-started-expand) to extend
what WGE can do for your organization.
