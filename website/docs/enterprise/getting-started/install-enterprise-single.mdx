# Step 1 - Getting Started <TierLabel tiers="Enterprise" />

You are a Platform Engineer looking to do hands-on discovery on the product or to set up the foundations for your WGE based platform.
Getting started gets  Weave GitOps Enterprise up and running quickly with default values for limited knowledge.

:::info Before Getting Started
- [ ] You are familiar Weave GitOps Enterprise [Concepts](/docs/references/concepts/).
- [ ] You have a **Git Repository** that you want to bootstrap with **write** permissions to push resources.
- [ ] You have a Kubeconfig pointing to your **Management Cluster** with **cluster-admin** to create resources.
- [ ] You have installed [Flux CLI](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#install-the-flux-cli) and [Weave GitOps Enterprise CLI](#weave-gitops-enterprise-cli)
   <Tabs groupId="weave-gitops-cli" default="homebrew">
   <TabItem value="homebrew" label="Homebrew">

   ```bash
    brew install weaveworks/tap/gitops-ee
   ```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

   ```bash
    export VERSION=$VERSION
    curl --silent --location "https://artifacts.wge.dev.weave.works/releases/bin/${VERSION}/gitops-$(uname)-$(uname -m).tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
    sudo mv /tmp/gitops /usr/local/bin
    gitops version
   ```

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
- [ ] You have **Weave GitOps Enterprise Entitlements** provided by [Sales](/help-and-support/).
:::

The installation workflow has the following stages:

1. [Bootstrap Flux](#bootstrap-flux)
2. [Entitlements](#entitlements)
3. [Authentication](#authentication)
4. [Authorization](#authorization)
5. [Install WGE](#install-wge)
6. [Access the dashboard](#access-the-dashboard)

:::warning Write Modes & Permissions
Bootstrapping requires you to have both **cluster admin** permissions on the Management Cluster and **push** permissions
to the Git repository to write the generated resources. In the case that you want just to generate the manifests but don't apply them,
you could use Manual route or use the CLI with the `--export` flag.

<Tabs groupId="flux bootstrap" default>
<TabItem value="CLI Interactive" label="CLI Interactive">

:::tip You have limited knowledge about the product and / or want guidance step-by-step
:::

 ```bash
 # Run the command to follow the interactive session.
 gitops bootstrap
 ```

<AlphaWarning/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CLI Non Interactive" label="CLI Non Interactive">

:::tip You are already familiar with installing Weave GitOps Enterprise and want to leverage the CLI for convenience
:::

You could run the bootstrap command in non-interactive mode by providing the required configurations as flags. Use `gitops bootstrap --help` for examples to guide you:

```bash
# Bootstrap Weave GitOps Enterprise and Flux over SSH
gitops bootstrap --silent --bootstrap-flux \
    --version="0.38.0" --password=<admin-password> \
    --repo-url=ssh://<repo-url> --branch=<git-branch> --repo-path=<path-management-cluster>  \
    --private-key-path=<private-key-path> --private-key-password=<private-key-password>

# Add Weave GitOps Enterprise to an existing SSH Flux installation
gitops bootstrap --silent \
    --version="0.38.0" --password=<admin-password> \
    --repo-url=ssh://<repo-url> --branch=<git-branch> --repo-path=<path-management-cluster>  \
    --private-key-path=<private-key-path> --private-key-password=<private-key-password>

```

The following sections will deep dive on each of the stages giving finer guidance for bootstrapping. For manual approach,
it will give the commands required. For the cli approach, it expands the available flags per stage.

### Bootstrap Flux

This stage is about bootstrapping Fux which involves deploying Flux into the management cluster and configure it to reconcile your Git repository.

<Tabs groupId="flux bootstrap" default>
<TabItem value="cli" label="cli">

You could configure this stage by using the following flags and examples:

```bash
 # bootstrap WGE and Flux using HTTPS
 gitops bootstrap --repo-url="https://example.com/repository.git" --branch="main" --repo-path="clusters/management" --git-username="username" --git-password="password"

 # bootstrap WGE and Flux using SSH
 gitops bootstrap --repo-url="ssh://git@example.com/repository.git" --branch="main" --repo-path="clusters/management" --private-key="path/to/private.key"  --private-key-password="password"
```
For more information about the CLI configurations, check the below sections [here](#cli-configurations)
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" label="manual">

The `flux bootstrap` command enables you to deploy Flux on a cluster the GitOps way. See the different
option [Flux bootstrap](https://fluxcd.io/docs/cmd/flux_bootstrap/) documentation.

Two examples using [`flux bootstrap git`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/cmd/flux_bootstrap_git/) are:

```bash
# Run bootstrap for a Git repository and authenticate using a password
flux bootstrap git --url="https://example.com/repository.git" --"password=password" --path="clusters/my-cluster"

# Run bootstrap for a Git repository with a private key and password
flux bootstrap git --url="ssh://git@example.com/repository.git" --private-key-file="path/to/private.key" --password="password" --path="clusters/my-cluster"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Entitlements

Weave GitOps Enterprise Entitlement is your obtained license to use our product. The Entitlements file is a Kubernetes secret that contains your licence.
To get the entitlement secret please contact *sales@weave.works*, then apply it on your management cluster with the name `weave-gitops-enterprise-credentials` under `flux-system` namespace.

```bash
 kubectl apply -n flux-system -f entitlements.yaml
```

:::info Verify Entitlements

The following verification is done when bootstrapping using the CLI:
- The secret exists on the management cluster
- It has a valid content
- Entitlement is not expired

:::

### Authentication

There are two supported authentication methods for Weave GitOps Enterprise:

- `OIDC`: allows you to control permissions for existing users and groups that have already been configured to use OIDC. OIDC decouples the need to manage user lists from the application, allowing it to be managed via
a central system designed for that purpose (i.e. the OIDC provider). OIDC also enables the creation of groups—either via your provider's own systems or by using a connector like [Dex](#configuring-oidc-with-dex-and-github).
- `Cluster User`: only recommended for development environments or if you need to activate emergency access to a damaged cluster. However, it is an option if an OIDC provider is not available.

The both work with standard Kubernetes RBAC for authorization.

<Tabs groupId="authentication" default>
<TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI">

In interactive mode you will be guided to setup authentication for both Cluster User and OIDC.
In non-interactive mode you have the following flags to configure authentication:

```bash
# setup Cluster User 'wego-admin' with password 'admin123'
gitops bootstrap --password="admin123"

# setup OIDC authentication
gitops bootstrap --discovery-url="https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration" \
--client-id="weave-gitops-enterprise", --client-secret="clientSecretWeaveGitopsEnterprise"
```

For more information about the CLI configurations, check the below sections [here](#cli-configurations)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Manual OIDC" label="Manual OIDC">

You may decide to give your engineering teams access to the WGE dashboard so they can view and manage their workloads. In this case, you will want to secure dashboard access and restrict who can interact with it. Weave GitOps Enterprise integrates with your OIDC provider and uses standard Kubernetes RBAC to give you fine-grained control of the dashboard users' permissions.

OIDC extends the OAuth2 authorization protocol by including an additional field (ID Token) that contains information (claims) about a user's identity. After a user successfully authenticates with the OIDC provider, Weave GitOps Enterprise uses this information to impersonate the user in any calls to the Kubernetes API. This allows cluster administrators to use RBAC rules to control access to the cluster and the dashboard.

For more specific examples of how to setup OIDC with Weave GitOps, see [this guide](../../../guides/oidc/).

If you run into issues setting up OIDC with Weave GitOps, please refer to the [`gitops check oidc-config` command](../../../references/cli-reference/gitops_check_oidc-config/)

To login via your OIDC provider, create a Kubernetes secret to store the OIDC configuration. This configuration consists of the following parameters:

| Parameter         |  Description                                                                                                                      | Default   |
| ------------------|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `issuerURL`       |  The URL of the issuer; typically, the discovery URL without a path                                                                |           |
| `clientID`        |  The client ID set up for Weave GitOps in the issuer                                                                 |           |
| `clientSecret`    |  The client secret set up for Weave GitOps in the issuer                                                             |           |
| `redirectURL`     |  The redirect URL set up for Weave GitOps in the issuer—typically the dashboard URL, followed by `/oauth2/callback ` |           |
| `tokenDuration`   |  The time duration that the ID Token will remain valid after successful authentication                                           | "1h0m0s"  |
| `tokenDuration`   |  The time duration that the ID Token will remain valid after successful authentication                                           | "1h0m0s"  |
| `oidcUsernamePrefix` | The prefix added to users when impersonating API calls to the Kubernetes API, equivalent to --oidc-username-prefix | |
| `oidcGroupsPrefix` | The prefix added to groups when impersonating API calls to the Kubernetes API, equivalent to --oidc-groups-prefix | |

Ensure that your OIDC provider has been set up with a client ID/secret and the dashboard's redirect URL.

Create a secret named `oidc-auth` in the `flux-system` namespace with these parameters set:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic oidc-auth \
  --namespace flux-system \
  --from-literal=issuerURL="oidc-issuer-url" \
  --from-literal=clientID="client-id" \
  --from-literal=clientSecret="client-secret" \
  --from-literal=redirectURL="redirect-url" \
  --from-literal=tokenDuration="token-duration"
```

:::warning
Currently, we do not have a persistent session storage, this means that if you scale to multiple replicas, logins will not be persisted.
:::

Once the HTTP server starts, unauthenticated users will have to click 'Login With OIDC Provider' to log in.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Manual Cluster User" label="Manual Cluster User">

:::danger Important
This is an **insecure** method of accessing your dashboard. We only see useful in any of the following scenarios:
- You cannot directly get started directly with OIDC so you create the cluster user for convenience.
- Its a local and development environments.
- You need to activate the user for emergency access to a damaged environment.

For secure and fully-featured authentication we **strongly recommend** using an OIDC provider and remove the Cluster User
before onboarding other users.
:::

**Configuring the Cluster User**

Before you log in via the Cluster User account, you need to generate a bcrypt hash for your chosen password and store it as a secret in Kubernetes. There are several different ways to generate a bcrypt hash. This guide uses `gitops get bcrypt-hash` from our CLI.

Generate the password by running:

```bash
PASSWORD="your password"
echo -n $PASSWORD | gitops get bcrypt-hash

$2a$10$OS5NJmPNEb13UgTOSKnMxOWlmS7mlxX77hv4yAiISvZ71Dc7IuN3q
```

Now create a Kubernetes secret to store your chosen username and the password hash:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic cluster-user-auth \
  --namespace flux-system \
  --from-literal=username=wego-admin \
  --from-literal=password='$2a$10$OS5NJmPNEb13UTOSKngMxOWlmS7mlxX77hv4yAiISvZ71Dc7IuN3q'
```

You should now be able to login via the cluster user account using your chosen username and password.

### Authorization

Weave GitOps Enterprise works with standard [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
to define what actions can a subject do-over the existing resources.

Weave GitOps requires authorization for the following subjects:

- **Weave GitOps Users:** previously authenticated via either OIDC or Cluster User.
- **Weave GitOps Service Account:** which talks to Kubernetes for user operations via [Impersonation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation).
- **Flux Service Accounts:** which talks to Kubernetes for deployments operations.

When installing Weave GitOps Enterprise HelmRelease with the default values, a default authorization context for each of the
previous subjects are created. This section introduces it, as well its motivation and how you could customise it.

:::caution

CLI does not support Authorization yet. It should be hadled as part of https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops-enterprise/issues/3618


// TODO cli should automate creating any manual step for example the bases patterns and to validate that the setup is stable.
:::

<Tabs groupId="authorization" default>
<TabItem value="Cluster User" label="Cluster User">
Weave GitOps Enterprise HelmRelease installed with the defaults values that allows `wego-admin` user to have high privileges,
so you could temporarily manage the aspect of bootstrapping with smaller friction:

It creates a set of `ClusterRoleBinding` that allow `cluster-admin` access to the resources in the cluster.

```bash
kubectl get clusterrolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io |grep wego-admin

```

:::caution Flux and Weave GitOps trust
We currently assume fully trusted security context at the level of flux-system namespace. This represents a challenge
in terms of least-privilege access to be tackled as part of https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/issues/4036
:::

// TODO add me explorer access rules debug view

See how to harden this section in [Day 1 Cluster User](#cluster-user).
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="OIDC Users" label="OIDC Users">

OIDC is highly context dependent, during bootstrapping no RBAC resources are created but expected to exist
in your configuration repo. In case that they dont exist, you will be able to login but will have limited access to the resources.

// TODO refactor as general pattern not only in the context of OIDC

A common pattern called `Bases` helps you getting started with OIDC RBAC:

1. Create a folder in your Git repo in path like `clusters/bases`.
2. Add your RBAC resources into the folder `clusters/bases/rbac`.
3. Create a folder `clusters/management` adding the following `Kustomization`:

```yaml title="clusters/management/clusters-bases-kustomization.yaml"
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: clusters-bases-kustomization
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 10m0s
  path: clusters/bases
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system
```

Save these two files in your Git repository, then commit and push. Flux will deploy the kustomization and the RBAC
resources will be created.

See how to harden this section in [Day 1](#oidc-authorization).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Service Accounts" label="Service Accounts">

**Weave GitOps Service Account**

The default install will create the RBA resources that allow the service account to do the following:

1. [Impersonate Users and Service Accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation) the user and operate in the cluster as them
2. Read the available namespaces; this is required to understand users' permissions.
3. Read the `cluster-user-auth` and `oidc-auth` resources with the secrets for authentication.

**Flux Service Accounts**

They are generated during Flux Bootstrapping. More information about Flux Authorization could be found [here](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/configuration/multitenancy/#flux-authorisation-model).
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Install WGE

We install Weave GitOps Enterprise via Flux Helm Release that you could deploy via the CLI or manually:

<Tabs groupId="install wge" default>
<TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI">

You could configure this stage by using the following flags and examples:

 ```bash
 # Configure bootstrapping to install WGE version '0.37.0'
 gitops bootstrap --version="0.37.0"
 ```

For more information about the CLI configurations, check the below sections [here](#cli-configurations)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Manual" label="Manual">

Download the following `HelmRelease` to `clusters/management/weave-gitops-enterprise.yaml`.

import ExampleWGE from "../../assets/example-enterprise-helm.yaml";
import ExampleWGEContent from "!!raw-loader!../../assets/example-enterprise-helm.yaml";

<details><summary>Expand to see file contents</summary>

<CurlCodeBlock
  localPath="clusters/management/weave-gitops-enterprise.yaml"
  hostedPath={ExampleWGE}
  content={ExampleWGEContent}
/>

</details>


Edit and adjust the following configuration options:

`values.config.capi.repositoryURL`: ensure this has been set to your repository URL.

`values.config.capi.repositoryPath`: by default, WGE will create new clusters in the `clusters/management/clusters` path.
You can configure it with `values.config.capi.repositoryPath`.
You might what to change it to `clusters/my-cluster/cluster` if you configured Flux to reconcile `./clusters/my-cluster` instead.

`values.config.capi.repositoryClustersPath`: the other important path to configure is where you'll store applications and workloads run on the new cluster.
By default this is `./clusters`. When a new cluster is specified, any selected profiles will be written to `./clusters/{.namespace}/{.clusterName}/profiles.yaml`.
When the new cluster is bootstrapped, Flux will sync the `./clusters/{.namespace}/{.clusterName}` path.

Commit and push all the files

```bash
git add clusters/management/weave-gitops-enterprise.yaml
git commit -m "Deploy Weave GitOps Enterprise"
git push
```

Flux will reconcile the helm-release and WGE will be deployed into the cluster. You can check the `flux-system` namespace to verify all pods are running.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Access the dashboard

Weave GitOps Enterprise dashboard is available by default via ClusterIP service. You could use the `port-forward` command
output as part of the bootstrapping session or the one below:

```bash
 kubectl -n flux-system port-forward svc/clusters-service 8000:8000
```
Access your browser on http://localhost:8000

![Weave GitOps Enterprise Login](./imgs/wge-login-ui.png)

Login with the user credentials that you have configured as part of the bootstrapping session.

## Day 1: Customise and Complete

Now that you have Weave GitOps Enterprise up and running, you might want to iterate your setup before opening to the rest of
the users. This section shows you the different options that you could configure to adapt Weave GitOps Enterprise to your needs.

### Authorization

#### Cluster User

**User Permissions**

By default, both a ClusterRole and Role are generated for the Cluster User.
Both have the same permissions, with the former being optional and the latter being
bound to the `flux-system` namespace (where Flux stores its resources by default).
The default set of rules are configured like this:

```yaml
rules:
  # Flux Resources
  - apiGroups: ["source.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "buckets", "helmcharts", "gitrepositories", "helmrepositories", "ocirepositories" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "kustomizations" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "helmreleases" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: [ "notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io" ]
    resources: [ "providers", "alerts" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["infra.contrib.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: ["terraforms"]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  # Read access for all other Kubernetes objects
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch" ]
```

These permissions give the Cluster User Administrator-level powers. **We do not
advise leaving it active on production systems**.

If required, the permissions can be expanded with the `rbac.additionalRules` field in the
[Helm Chart](../../references/helm-reference.md).

Follow the instructions in the next section in order to configure RBAC correctly.

#### OIDC

// TODO Uses bases pattern to configure OIDC

#### Weave GitOps Service Account

This section covers the service account [permissions]
for the Weave GitOps application, which the WGE UI requires to work.
The default permissions will generate a cluster role that includes the permissions:

```yaml
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources:  ["users", "groups"]
  verbs: [ "impersonate" ]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: [ "secrets" ]
  verbs: [ "get", "list" ]
- apiGroups: [ "" ]
  resources: [ "namespaces" ]
  verbs: [ "get", "list" ]
```

These allow the pod to do three things:
* [Impersonate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation) the user and operate in the cluster as them
* Read the available namespaces; this is required to understand users' permissions
* Read the `cluster-user-auth` and `oidc-auth` secrets, the default secrets
to store the emergency cluster user account and OIDC configuration (see
[securing access to the dashboard](#securing-access-to-the-dashboard))

#### Impersonation

The primary way Weave GitOps queries the Kube API is via `impersonation`. The permissions granted to users and groups that Weave GitOps
can impersonate will determine the scope of actions that WGE can take within your cluster.

The application, not the cluster, authenticates the user, either via the [emergency
cluster user](#configuring-the-emergency-user) credentials or OIDC. Then it makes Kube API calls on the user's
behalf. This is equivalent to making a kubectl call like:

```bash
$ kubectl get deployments --as aisha@example.com
```

Assuming the user `aisha@example.com` has permissions to get
deployments within the cluster, this will return those deployments. The same occurs
within the application, so properly configuring application
permissions is very important. Without proper restrictions the application can impersonate
very powerful `users` or `groups`. For example, the `system:masters` is a group
generally bound to the `cluster-admin` role, which can do anything.

#### Get Namespaces

The application itself uses get namespace permissions to pre-cache the list of
available namespaces. As the user accesses resources their permissions within
various namespaces is also cached to speed up future operations.

#### Reading the `cluster-user-auth` and `oidc-auth` Secrets

The `cluster-user-auth` and `oidc-auth` secrets provide information for authenticating
to the application. The former holds the username and bcrypt-hashed password
for the [emergency user](#configuring-the-emergency-user), and the latter holds OIDC configuration.

The application needs to be able to access these secrets in order to
authenticate users.

### User Permissions

This section discusses the [Kubernetes permissions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
needed by Weave GitOps application users and groups. At a minimum, a User should be bound to a Role in the `flux-system` namespace—which is where
Flux stores its resources by default—with the following permissions:

```yaml
rules:
  # Flux Resources
  - apiGroups: ["source.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "buckets", "helmcharts", "gitrepositories", "helmrepositories", "ocirepositories" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "kustomizations" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "helmreleases" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: [ "notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io" ]
    resources: [ "providers", "alerts" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  - apiGroups: ["infra.contrib.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: ["terraforms"]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch", "patch" ]

  # Read access for all other Kubernetes objects
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch" ]
```

For a wider scope, the User can be bound to a ClusterRole with the same set.

On top of this you can add other permissions to view WGE resources like `GitOpsSets` and `Templates`.

#### Flux Resources

The following table lists resources that Flux works with directly.

| API Group                      | Resources                                                               | Permissions      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io    | kustomizations                                                          | get, list, patch |
| helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io         | Helm Releases                                                            | get, list, patch |
| source.toolkit.fluxcd.io       | buckets, Helm charts, Git repositories, Helm repositories, OCI repositories | get, list, patch |
| notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io | providers, alerts                                                       | get, list        |
| infra.contrib.fluxcd.io        | [Terraform](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller)                                                             | get, list, patch |

Weave GitOps needs to be able to query the [CRDs](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/) that Flux uses before it can accurately display Flux state. The
`get` and `list` permissions facilitate this.

The `patch` permissions are used for two features: to suspend and resume
reconciliation of a resource by modifying the 'spec' of a resource,
and to force reconciliation of a resource by modifying resource annotations. These features work in the same way that `flux suspend`,
`flux resume`, and `flux reconcile` does on the CLI.

#### Resources Managed via Flux

| API Group                 | Resources                                                                      | Permissions      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| ""                        | configmaps, secrets, pods, services, persistent volumes, persistent volume claims | get, list, watch |
| apps                      | deployments, replica sets, stateful sets                                         | get, list, watch |
| batch                     | jobs, cron jobs                                                                 | get, list, watch |
| autoscaling               | horizontal pod autoscalers                                                       | get, list, watch |
| rbac.authorization.k8s.io | roles, cluster roles, rolebindings, cluster role bindings                         | get, list, watch |
| networking.k8s.io         | ingresses                                                                      | get, list, watch |

Weave GitOps reads basic resources so that it can monitor the effect that Flux has
on what's running.

Reading `secrets` enables Weave GitOps to monitor the state of Helm releases
as that's where it stores the [state by default](https://helm.sh/docs/faq/changes_since_helm2/#secrets-as-the-default-storage-driver).
For clarity this these are the Helm release objects _not_ the Flux HelmRelease
resource (which are dealt with by the earlier section).

#### Feedback from Flux

Flux communicates the status of itself primarily via events.
These events will show when reconciliations start and stop, whether they're successful,
and information as to why they're not.

## Recommended RBAC Configuration

This section is purposefully vague as we intend to give a broad idea of how to implement such a system. The specifics will dependent
on your circumstances and goals.

Our general recommendation is to use OIDC and a small number of groups that Weave GitOps can impersonate.

Configuring Weave GitOps to impersonate Kubernetes groups rather than users has the following benefits:
* A user's permissions for impersonation by Weave GitOps can be separate from
any other permissions that they may or may not have within the cluster.
* Users do not have to be individually managed within the cluster and can have
their permissions managed together.

### Example Setup

Assume that your company has the following people in OIDC:
* Aisha, a cluster admin, who should have full admin access to Weave GitOps
* Brian, lead of Team-A, who should have admin permissions to their team's
namespace in Weave GitOps and read-only otherwise
* June and Jo, developers in Team-A who should have read-only access to Weave GitOps

You can then create three groups:

* `wego-admin`
- Bound to the `ClusterRole`, created by Helm, `wego-admin-cluster-role`
- Aisha is the only member
* `wego-team-a-admin`
- Bound to a `Role`, using the same permissions as `wego-admin-role`, created
in Team-A's namespace
- Brian and Aisha are members
* `wego-readonly`
- Bound to a `ClusterRole` that matches `wego-admin-cluster-role` but with
no `patch` permissions.
- Aisha, Brian, June and Jo are all members

:::caution Using OIDC for cluster and Weave GitOps Authentication
If the same OIDC provider is used to authenticate a user with the cluster
itself (e.g. for use with `kubectl`) and to Weave GitOps then, depending
on OIDC configuration, they may end up with the super-set of their permissions
from Weave GitOps and any other permissions granted to them.

This can lead to unintended consequences, like viewing `secrets`. To avoid
this, OIDC providers will often let you configure which groups are returned
to which clients. The Weave GitOps groups should not be returned to the
cluster client (and vice versa).
:::

### Code

The yaml to configure these permissions would look roughly like:

<details>
    <summary>Expand to see example RBAC</summary>

    ---
    ```

</details>



### TLS Configuration

By default, the WGE UI pod will listen on port `8000` with TLS enabled.
WGE will generate and use a self-signed certificate for this purpose.

It can then be accessed via port-forwarding:

`kubectl port-forward --namespace flux-system svc/clusters-service 8000:8000`

If you're using an ingress controller to terminate TLS you can disable it in the Helm release:

```yaml
  values:
    tls:
      enabled: false
```

Other ingress configuration changes can be made via the ingress configuration

```yaml
  values:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      ... other parameters specific to the ingress type ...
```

### Cluster User

#### Updating the Cluster User

To change either the username or the password, recreate the `cluster-user-auth`
with the new details.

Only one Cluster User can be created this way. To add more users, enable an OIDC provider.

#### Remove Cluster User Authentication

To remove the Cluster User as a login method, set the following values in the
[Helm Chart](../../references/helm-reference.md):

```yaml
#
adminUser:
  create: false
#
additionalArgs:
- --auth-methods=oidc
#
```
:::caution If you are disabling an already existing Cluster User

If you are disabling an already existing Cluster User, you will need to
manually delete the Kubernetes Secret and any User Roles that were created on
the cluster.

:::


### OIDC

#### Customization

For some OIDC configurations, you may need to customise the requested [scopes](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) or [claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims).

The `oidcUsernamePrefix` and `oidcGroupsPrefix` work in the same way as the Kubernetes [kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) command-line options, if you need them for Kubernetes, you will likely need them here.

#### Scopes

By default, the following scopes are requested: "openid","offline_access","email","groups".

The "openid" scope is **mandatory** for OpenID auth and will be added if not provided. The "email" and "groups" scopes are commonly used as unique identifiers in organisations.

"offline_access" allows us to refresh OIDC tokens to keep login sessions alive for as long as a refresh token is valid. You can, however, change the defaults.
```sh
kubectl create secret generic oidc-auth \
  --namespace flux-system \
  --from-literal=issuerURL=$oidc-issuer-url \
  --from-literal=clientID=$client-id \
  --from-literal=clientSecret=$client-secret \
  --from-literal=redirectURL=redirect-url \
  --from-literal=tokenDuration=token-duration \
  --from-literal=customScopes=custom,scopes
```
The format for the `customScopes` key is a comma-separated list of scopes to request. In this case, "custom", "scopes", and "openid" would be requested.

#### Claims

By default, the following claims are parsed from the OpenID [ID Token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeIDToken) "email" and "groups". These are presented as the `user` and `groups` when WGE communicates with your Kubernetes API server.

This is equivalent to [configuring](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#configuring-the-api-server) your `kube-apiserver` with `--oidc-username-claim=email --oidc-groups-claim=groups`.

Again, you can configure these from the `oidc-auth` `Secret`.

```sh
kubectl create secret generic oidc-auth \
  --namespace flux-system \
  --from-literal=issuerURL=oidc-issuer-url \
  --from-literal=clientID=client-id \
  --from-literal=clientSecret=client-secret \
  --from-literal=redirectURL=redirect-url \
  --from-literal=tokenDuration=token-duration \
  --from-literal=claimUsername=sub \
  --from-literal=claimGroups=groups
```
There are two separate configuration keys. You can override them separately. They should match your `kube-apiserver` configuration.

### Customise the UI

#### Login

The label of the OIDC button on the login screen is configurable via a feature flag environment variable.
This can give your users a more familiar experience when logging in.

Adjust the configuration in the Helm `values.yaml` file or the `spec.values` section of the Weave GitOps `HelmRelease` resource:

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: WEAVE_GITOPS_FEATURE_OIDC_BUTTON_LABEL
    value: "Login with ACME"
```

### Install Other Components

#### Cluster Management via CAPI

TBA

#### Policy via Weave Policy Agent

To install [Policy Agent](../../policy/intro.mdx) follow any of the following approaches:

<Tabs groupId="policy agent" default>
<TabItem value="cli" label="cli">

You could configure this stage by using the following flags and examples:

```bash
 # install Policy Agent alongside Weave GitOps Enterprise
 gitops bootstrap --components-extra="policy-agent"
```

For more information about the CLI configurations, check the below sections [here](#cli-configurations)
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" label="manual">

[Policy agent](../../policy/intro.mdx) comes packaged with the WGE chart. To install it, set the following values:

- `values.policy-agent.enabled`: set to true to install the agent with WGE
- `values.policy-agent.config.accountId`: organization name, used as identifier
- `values.policy-agent.config.clusterId`: unique identifier for the cluster

Commit and push all the files

```bash
git add clusters/management/weave-gitops-enterprise.yaml
git commit -m "Deploy Weave GitOps Enterprise"
git push
```

Flux will reconcile the helm-release and WGE will be deployed into the cluster. You can check the `flux-system` namespace to verify all pods are running.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Infrastructure via Tf-Controller

// TBA


### Configure Write Access to Git

Weave GitOps Enterprise creates pull requests for adding resources. To do this, it needs to be able to write to the Git repository.
Here we provide guidance for GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket Server, and Azure DevOps.

<Tabs groupId="git-provider" default>
<TabItem value="github" label="GitHub">
GitHub requires no additional configuration for OAuth git access
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab">

Create a GitLab OAuth application that will request `api` permissions to create pull requests on your behalf.

Follow the [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html).

The application should have at least these scopes:

- `api`
- `openid`
- `email`
- `profile`

Add callback URLs to the application for each address the UI will be exposed on, e.g.:

- `https://localhost:8000/oauth/gitlab` for port-forwarding and testing
- `https://git.example.com/oauth/gitlab` for production use

Save your application, taking note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save
them into the `git-provider-credentials` secret, along with:

- `GIT_HOST_TYPES` to tell WGE that the host is gitlab
- `GITLAB_HOSTNAME` where the OAuth app is hosted

**Replace values** in this snippet and run:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system \
  --from-literal="GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=13457" \
  --from-literal="GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=24680" \
  --from-literal="GITLAB_HOSTNAME=git.example.com" \
  --from-literal="GIT_HOST_TYPES=git.example.com=gitlab"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bitbucket-server" label="BitBucket Server">

Create a new [incoming application link](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/configure-an-incoming-link-1108483657.html) from
the BitBucket administration dashboard. You will be asked to enter a unique name and the redirect URL for the external application. The redirect URL
should be set to `$WGE_DASHBOARD_URL/oauth/bitbucketserver`. You will also need to select permissions for the application. The minimum set of
permissions needed for WGE to create pull requests on behalf of users is `Repositories - Write`. An example of configuring these settings is shown below.

<figure>

<img src={oauthBitbucket} width="500"/>

<figcaption>Configuring a new incoming application link</figcaption>
</figure>


Save your application and take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save
them into the `git-provider-credentials` secret, along with:

- `GIT_HOST_TYPES` to tell WGE that the host is bitbucket-server
- `BITBUCKET_SERVER_HOSTNAME` where the OAuth app is hosted

**Replace values** in this snippet and run:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system \
  --from-literal="BITBUCKET_SERVER_CLIENT_ID=13457" \
  --from-literal="BITBUCKET_SERVER_CLIENT_SECRET=24680" \
  --from-literal="BITBUCKET_SERVER_HOSTNAME=git.example.com" \
  --from-literal="GIT_HOST_TYPES=git.example.com=bitbucket-server"
```

If the secret is already present, use the following command to update it using your default editor:

```bash
kubectl edit secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system
```

:::info

If BitBucket Server is running on the default port (7990), make sure you include the port number in the values of the secret. For example: `GIT_HOST_TYPES=git.example.com:7990=bitbucket-server`

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="azure-devops" label="Azure DevOps">

Navigate to [VisualStudio](https://app.vsaex.visualstudio.com/app/register) and register a new application, as explained in the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth?view=azure-devops#1-register-your-app). Set the authorization callback URL and select which scopes to grant. Set the callback URL to `$WGE_DASHBOARD_URL/oauth/azuredevops`.

Select the `Code (read and write)` scope from the list. This is necessary so that WGE can create pull requests on behalf of users. An example of configuring these settings is shown below.

<figure>
<img src={oauthAzureDevOps}/>
<figcaption>Creating a new application</figcaption>
</figure>

After creating your application, you will be presented with the application settings. Take note of the `App ID` and `Client Secret` values—you will use them to configure WGE.

<figure>
<img src={oauthAzureDevOpsSuccess}/>
<figcaption>Application settings</figcaption>
</figure>

In your cluster, create a secret named `git-provider-credentials` that contains the `App ID` and `Client Secret` values from the newly created application.

**Replace values** in this snippet and run:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic git-provider-credentials --namespace=flux-system \
  --from-literal="AZURE_DEVOPS_CLIENT_ID='App ID value'" \
  --from-literal="AZURE_DEVOPS_CLIENT_SECRET='Client Secret value'"
```

WGE is now configured to ask users for authorization the next time a pull request must be created as part of using a template.
Note that each user can view and manage which applications they have authorized by navigating to https://app.vsaex.visualstudio.com/me.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Next Steps

Here are a couple of options for you to take your next steps with WGE. Explore one option or all of them, in no particular order.

- [Cluster Management](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/next/cluster-management/intro/): We'll show you how to join WGE to a cluster and install an application on that cluster *without* using Cluster API. But if you prefer using Cluster API, our docs cover that too.
- Install the [Terraform Controller](https://weaveworks.github.io/tf-controller/) to reconcile your Terraform resources in a GitOps way. With Flux and the TF Controller, WGE makes it easy to add Terraform templates to your clusters and continuously reconcile any changes made to the Terraform source manifest.
- Install [Policy agent](../../policy/intro.mdx), which comes packaged with the WGE chart.
