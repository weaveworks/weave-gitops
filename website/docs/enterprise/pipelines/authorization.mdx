This section provides a recommended way to configure RBAC in the context of pipelines. It is oriented to the journey
that you expect your users to have.

## View pipelines

In order to view pipelines, users would need to have read access to the `pipeline` resource and the underlying `application` resources.

An example of configuration to achieve this purpose could be seen below with `pipeline-reader` role and `search-pipeline-reader`
role-binding to allow a group `search-developer` to access pipeline resources within `search` namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: pipeline-reader
rules:
  - apiGroups: [ "pipelines.weave.works" ]
    resources: [ "pipelines" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: ["helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io"]
    resources: [ "helmreleases" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list", "watch"]

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: search-pipeline-reader
  namespace: search
subjects:
  - kind: Group
    name: search-developer
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: pipeline-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
